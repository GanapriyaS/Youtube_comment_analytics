1825,"@KUMUD RANJAN Please let us know about<br>1. Quality Guide Books specifically meant for Each Semester.<br>2. Guide Books for Each Lab subject.<br>I have been assessing the real learning environment for long time<br>in CS since it was introduced in Indian Engineering colleges.<br>Large numbers of Engineering colleges have proliferated in the last few years. But Students find it very difficult to pursue properly.<br>In one semester they have to learn large numbers of topics. Within such a short period of time they can&#39;t learn even the Basics of any topic quite extensively.<br>So I request you to write High Quality Guide Books for each semester covering each topic for both Theory and Practicals.<br>2. Please make a video series for such subjects strictly according to the latest syllabus by You.<br>There are many you tube videos for such subjects but I request you<br>to upload such videos which can help students securing more marks in their each semester end exam.<br>3. BPB Techmedia published such kind of exam oriented Guide Books only for O, A, B and C level exams but not for Engineering students pursuing Computer Science in Engineering Colleges.<br>I hope you would do something in this regard.<br>Also please let me know about such guide books for BE/ B, Tech<br>Computer Science that currently exists. <br>I have been providing free career counseling to different students.<br>I would be very much obliged if<br>you provide me the information regarding these.<br>Thank you very much for your nice video.<br>With lots of love and regards,<br>Jayantàda,<br>24/05/2021<br>RSVP"

1863,Bhai computer hacking kis chapter me h G
1864,Be positive rather than going into b tech directly you can take admission in polytechnic for diploma in cse as you told this special case (because I too have PCB so I would be taking DCSE I.e diploma in computer science engineering and than after that I will apply for LEET for LATERAL ENTRY worth getting directly admission into  B TECH CSE.) Thats what the way is to get into the field......🔥Hope you understood this well ....good luck brother 👍💯
1865,"No, chemistry is an important subject. You cannot enroll in Cs without chemistry"
1866,Sir please tell that I am in 2021-22 batch 12 class and I have taken only physics and maths I haven&#39;t took chemistry in 12 class so may I eligible to do btech by computer and science engineering? Sir please tell 🙏🙏

4761,"So, What are you trying to tell? I didn&#39;t get you"
4762,Actually this is the thing.. always prefer branch over college. Cuz studying your branch side by side with practicing CSE and coding can be hella tough and shit considering the fact that the people who are already studying cse there will not sit back. There&#39;s rigourous hardwork needed. So why prefer college over branch? When it&#39;ll matter less asf than your actual skillet?

5086,I m trying to be extrovert till I go to the college because in school i was an introvert and it was very difficult or we can say more typical to express your emotions
5087,"@Ajay I&#39;m a guy who has social anxiety, and I don&#39;t speak much to people, so it is different from the actual meaning of introvert. What do we actually call it?"
5088,@Ajay lol exactly and that wouldn&#39;t actually work or make sense if people knew what the actual meaning of introvert is.
5089,"@Aadith so true. Some people need to learn communication skills but to escape from this, they declare themselves as Introverts. (i have realised recently, i was one of them)"

5095,Di can u make how can we change any branch in clg
5096,"Summary <br><br>1. NIRF Rankings (based on many factors which includes campus size &amp; sports opportunities) are important but priority should be fee structure, placement &amp; opportunities. + Brand Image Matters, Don&#39;t limit yourself to your branch only! Chemical Engineers can be coders too.<br><br>2. Laptops are important, have it asap! <br><br>3. Online PDFs are boon<br><br>4. Social Interactions are important, since communication helps a lot in career. Spend time with new &amp; like minded people. Be open and keep improving!<br><br>5. Explore Opportunities like hell but always have motive and goals. Create hobbies, make experiences explore different things &amp; dynamics, including startups, government internships in ISRO and DRDO and everything."

5101,"Guys core branches r difficult to study, u need to give alot of effort, and gate becomes imp. Generally ppl in core are those students who wanted to go for other branche or pursue mba later.<br>So if you think that software can be done easily, you need to give extra time and work it by yourself <br><br>While in branches like cse it&#39;s a part of curriculum so it&#39;s comparatively easy and clg faculty make it easy to understand."

5164,Spam MICROSOFT WALI DIDI OP
5165,Actually this is the thing.. always prefer branch over college. Cuz studying your branch side by side with practicing CSE and coding can be hella tough and shit considering the fact that the people who are already studying cse there will not sit back. There&#39;s rigourous hardwork needed. So why prefer college over branch? When it&#39;ll matter less asf than your actual skillet?
5166,@Surya Facts lol
5167,@NanoTech TonyStark Harsha 😇

5305,"@Ranjana Srivastava In tier 3 college, there will be assignments, semester pressure, projects etc, but overall, these pressure is much much less and compared to tier 1 colleges, in tier 3 colleges, you will get ample time to prepare for UPSC, GATE etc( only if you don&#39;t spend time partying with friends and getting into weeds and alcohol), rest depends on your mindset. Time imps the most important thing in life, tier 3 colleges might have low placement standards as compared to other good colleges but the free time you get here in incomparable."

5410,Thank you for summarising!
5411,@Riya Jaiswal not necessary
5412,"Summary 🎉<br>1. NIRF Rankings (based on many factors which includes campus size &amp; sports opportunities) are important but priority should be fee structure, placement &amp; opportunities. + Brand Image Matters, Don&#39;t limit yourself to your branch only! Chemical Engineers can be coders too.<br><br>2. Laptops are important, have it asap! But don&#39;t need to be super expensive! 25 K ka basic laptop is cool for coding too.<br>Only limitations will be things like ML &amp;  Android Studio in low price laptop but didi too cracked Microsoft &amp; 2 internships with basic i3 Lappy.<br><br>3. Online PDFs are boon, make a habit according to your convenience asap since it is super cheap + convinient.<br><br>4. Social Interactions are important, since communication helps a lot in career. Spend time with new &amp; like minded people. Be open and keep improving!<br><br>5. Explore Opportunities like hell but always have motive and goals. Create hobbies, make experiences explore different things &amp; dynamics, including startups, government internships in isro and drdo and everything."

5642,This is so much easier to understand; I had got my associates degree in game development while also earning a certificate in programming; my teacher didn’t really explain it well to where the information stuck to me but I understood it to an extent but this way is much easier and more self explanatory.

5669,It should be illegal for anyone to give out soo much knowledge for free on a free public forum big up everyone involved
5670,I&#39;m a medium programmer and I just wanted to watch what the famous Harvard students study. It is insane how they are so well taught with the proper fundamentals. People should definitely spend more time searching for the right content to study than just diving into random poor quality stuff. Can be life changing
5671,I can&#39;t respect a coastal elite wearing a mask
5672,Thanks
5673,I can not get passed the mask. It makes it unwatchable. Will will look back at this time in history in disbelief.
5674,someone get this guy a towel or something
5675,I swear to god I felt suffocated watching the professor talk with the mask on.
5676,Outstanding course! Thank you so much. Clarified so many things. Really valuable.
5677,FREE COURSE!? 24 HOURS!? HOLY SMOKES!
5678,Bring a full  java video including (core advance plus all other connection++++ with some real projects)
5679,You are awesome 👍 dear

5682,are there puppets in the audience in the front seats :)))
5683,was I the only one that saw CSGO in the title
5684,why does he have a mask on stage?  smh... thx for the freebee
5685,I wish he removed his face mask 😷😄.<br>Thank you for the course. It&#39;s a privilege.

5694,"Thank You sir , Thanks Harvard , Thats a great blessing and its fact of nature if you bless you will be blessed , thank you so much😍😍"
5695,I&#39;m super impressed by the professor. Just his presentation abilities and the ability to just have code run and errors show when they should. If you&#39;ve ever tried to give a presentation before you know how literally anything you can think of can and will break and then stuff you didn&#39;t think can break...breaks.
5696,is it worth the 24h? idk if i should i this or learn programming language
5697,Finally I have completed this class.
5698,@Matty England again why is it not appropriate ? just because you think so? lol
5699,"@Movies and TV Shows are subjective He&#39;s 100% entitled to wear it, but that doesn&#39;t mean that normal people can&#39;t call him out for it. He sounds like he&#39;s suffocating at times. <br>You have the right to wear a pink spandex catsuit to a funeral if you wanted to, it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s appropriate or acceptable behaviour in the mind of a sane person."
5700,nah. its not. its personal choice and freedom just like your personal choice to not wear mask. nothing wrong with you not wearing mask. also nothing wrong with other people than you wearing mask.
5701,ew
5702,"Wearing a mask to give a lecture, while 30ft from the audience? 🙄 Pathetic."
5703,good for him
5704,I knew it was Harvard as soon as a guy comes out in a mask about 40 ft away from the nearest person

5711,"Why is the presenter wearing a mask, mf sounds hella out of breath lmaoooo"
5712,@Vitor Schaffer you&#39;re right 👍
5713,It was recorded in 2021
5714,Still using mask?

5726,Bro why is he wearing the same shirt
5727,@Bird thank you sir. I believe I picked that up in the beginning of the lecture. Thanks anyways!
5728,"@Ricardo Flores, Jr. Just so you have the right info.. The IDE is actually a Cloud Based machine running Ubuntu.  Part of the Linux OS. 😅"
5729,🤙 Keep up the grind!
5730,@Bird Perfect! Thank you so much.
5731,"Click on the link in the description of the video. Labeled as &quot;Slides, source code, and more at&quot;.  Once you&#39;re in there, you can click on the corresponding week that lines up with the  timestamps (also in description).  The homework assignments are the &quot;Problem Sets&quot; within each week&#39;s material.  Week 1&#39;s Problem Set 1 gives instructions on how to log into the codespace (IDE is a Cloud Based machine running Ubuntu) for this CS50 course.  This will allow you to follow along with the professor, especially since it contains things like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include"">#include</a> &lt;cs50.h&gt;, which is needed for much of the coding that takes place in the course."
5732,"Are there any links to homework assignments? Also, what IDE should I download to start practicing the code provided in the lectures? Thanks!"
5733,I thought it said Harvard CSGO Course
5734,same lol nothing screams &quot;I follow the science&quot; like wearing a piece of cloth over your face when the CDC has told us it does nothing
5735,Just started watching this and I can’t help but wonder why he’s wearing a mask with no one close to him
5736,1 day worth of video. it will take me a year to finish it

5747,"Thank you so much  for the free course.<br>Feel sorry for the instructor, he is sweating and has to wear a mask too.😷😷😓😓"
5748,its personal choice and freedom just like your personal choice to not wear mask. nothing wrong with you not wearing mask. also nothing wrong with other people than you wearing mask.
5749,"Really cool coarse indeed, but with all that intelligence, you are wearing a mask?  Are you serious?  Out of hear, I want to learn from intelligent people."
5750,What about &lt;stdio.h&gt; and main(void) ? Is it standard we just use it to start the program?
5751,"<b>*make*</b> compiles your program (translates it for the computer), and <b>*./*</b> executes your program, assuming the .c file that your program is written in is in your current directory."
5752,Can someone pls explain the (make hello) and (./hello) why does he write it before he execute the program ?
5753,"This is amazing, but the mask makes me feel like he is going to pass out."
5754,"On the off chance anyone reads comments, I could use a hand:<br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=3h55m47s"">3:55:47</a> he demonstrates his code to print a square grid of the # character based on the number input by the user. So like a 3x3 grid if the user inputs 3.<br><br>Why does this code print # in a square grid? How does it know that one of the for loops is horizontal and one is vertical?<br><br>My best guess is the placement of his printf(&quot;\n&quot;) as it is outside of the second for loop. So like, it runs the first for loop and prints #, then runs the second for loop over and over until it fills out that row. THEN it prints the \n new line and starts the first for loop over. I think that might be right?<br><br>If any geniuses have a succinct explanation though I would still appreciate it.<br><br>EDIT: I think I finally get it, and it&#39;s kinda cool to see precisely how wrong I was. I needed to check another video on nested loops.<br><br>Basically, the outer loop runs which causes the inner loop to run X amount of times. (X being the amount the user input). When the inner loop finishes those X number of loops, it moves on to the end of the outer loop which prints a new line and starts another run of the outer loop, which then leads to X amount of inner loops being completed again.<br><br>Feels incredibly satisfying to struggle intensely with this fairly basic concept but then come to understand it a couple hours later."

5758,Yes it was killing me lol! He&#39;s a mile from other students and this is supposed to be Harvard. They haven&#39;t read the studies from over a year ago?? The masks didn&#39;t work bro he looks like he&#39;s gonna pass out
5759,"No.... I have ADHD and I am glued to this presentation. Even as somebody who disagrees with masks, it doesn&#39;t bother me in the slightest."
5760,Anyone else have trouble focusing on this because he&#39;s so out of breath with that mask on? JUST TAKE THE MASK OFF AND BREATHE! LOL

5769,I love this. Thank you.
5770,this class was too ez
5771,@Matty England ok
5772,@Movies and TV Shows are subjective It&#39;s his choice to wear a mask and it&#39;s my choice to make fun of him for it. What&#39;s your point? Was it just to make mine for me?
5773,@Elijah Obviously again. Its his choice. Just like your choice to not wear a mask. I dont know why you guys say you don&#39;t want to wear a mask because its your choice to be offended that someone else wears them.
5774,"​@Movies and TV Shows are subjective calls himself a &quot;scientist&quot;, teaches &quot;computer science&quot; at one of the most prestigious universities, wears sheet of fabric on his face despite every major study advising to the contrary lol. It&#39;s just a political statement at this point."
5775,"@Movies and TV Shows are subjective its called freedom of speech 🙂👍 I can say whatever I like, he can wear whatever he likes, and you&#39;re free to cry and whine about it.... Everyone is a winner 🙂👍"
5776,The fact that they made this poor guy wear a mask through 24 hours of presentation on a stage by himself is truly asinine.
5777,Is the mask a part of he/him it persona?
5778,Great! If you can survive the cringe and pay attention until the end you can really learn something. The cringe though....
5779,had me in the first half not gonna lie 😂

5786,"@room36 I don&#39;t disagree with you, however it was surely required by the school in the middle of 2021 when this was filmed. I&#39;m sure he was just doing what was necessary to continue teaching. It&#39;s not logical to lose your job over it."
5787,"@xymi this doesn&#39;t have anything to do with being scared or some sort of fear, at least to me. it just logically doesn&#39;t make sense to wear a mask on the stage of a gigantic theatre hall, probably with a few air conditioners, while frantically moving up and down with a couple of meters of distance to the students, who probably had to get tested for covid anyway to even take the course. so why wear a mask?"
5788,Are you scared of fabric?

5804,why is this the longest youtube video i have viewed
5805,"Two things pop right out right away - the intro is way long.  The part with the puppets not the instructor intro.  The other thing is why, why is this guy wearing a mask???  He is on stage, 20 or more feet away from everyone and he is masked?  Totally unnecessary.  Not only do we have to suffer through muffled speech but we do not get the facial expressions which according to one web post - Facial expressions are the primary type of non-verbal communication which, if utilized properly by teachers, can enhance the understanding of the students about the concepts taught in the classroom.  A very bad choice to mask the professor.  Besides, how can he breathe?"

5869,he&#39;s wearing a mask on stage bro
5870,A question to anyone who has seen the full clip:<br>Is this vid enough to learn programming or do you have to watch others as well?
5871,From my experience giving a presentation with a mask on is VERY difficult.  And his muffled speech is less than desirable for us as well.  Wish he made the decision not to wear it.

I read that we need to submit assignments to request for a completion certificate from cs50 but it&#39;s showing that we need to do it before 1st Jan 2023 ..Does it mean all problem sets including final project submission and what if I&#39;m short of last one or two assignments and submit it after that date ? Shall I be not eligible for certificate?

5905,well failure is my fault one hundred percent my fault in this generation.
5906,"For your information: the little lamps on the stage encode a message. They’re just bits and code for ASCII characters. I’ve seen “HI MOM”, SEGFAULT and &lt;\html&gt;. I’m not nerd enough to decode everything."

5914,"As someone who graduated over 20 years ago with a CS degree, and as someone who has taught introductory CS courses at a local university for several years, I skimmed over random bits of this course, and I like how clearly he explains and demonstrates every topic from programming concepts like recursion to web concepts like cURL and CSS. I recall that the web section in particular was also part of our coursebook, but was never actually covered in class, I read through the chapters and learned them myself and the concepts are a crucial part of work I do nowadays."

5918,"as a non American person that gets confused by all the comments here that are happy about a free university course.<br><br>Isn&#39;t every course in the states theoretically completely free? I always that, that be the law in the US you basically &quot;pay for the paper&quot;. So for that document/certificate that is proofing that you have passed a course, or the bachelors/masters degree.<br><br>In other words: &quot;couldn&#39;t you just walk into a room, listen to all the stuff for free.

5929,"I am a self taught programmer (IBM&#39;s CL language used in Midrange AS/400 computers) who learned to write programs by reading the code other programmers wrote and then writing my own through trial and error. I am no expert by any stretch but it was an added bonus when I taught myself computer operations by reading the manuals and being able to provide a better interpretation of the data. I was able to self educate enough to be able to manage Computer Departments for Billion dollar corporations and all because I was curious, able to read and understand the well written manuals and coded programs written by others. Oh how I wish I could have afforded a formal education let alone Harvard but this course offering is wonderful. Wouldn&#39;t it be amazing if all education was online and available to anyone with an internet connection, what a different world we would live in. Thanks Harvard."

5947,"To be honest I have never seen someone teaching that much energetic and attractive  either on internet or face to face.<br>And this man has all the attraction skills you can watch his videos for days and still cant feel board.<br>Any CS student must watch it, thanks to both Harvard and Freecodecamp for providing these useful lectures."
5948,I red the title as Harvard CSGO
5949,Please also upload CS50P also
5950,"It is embarrassing for me to be a part of the human race, when I see sheep in masks."
5951,Is it possible to learn to a degree standard without any other prior experience using this course? Or do I need to learn the basics first?
5952,huge respect from kenya
5953,"If you turn the lightbulbs on stage into text, with light ON being “1” and light OFF being “0” you get the following message: “HI MOM”.<br><br>You can try it out for yourselves:<br><br>01001000 01001001 00100000 01001101 01001111 01001101 00000000 00000000"
5954,This is what democracy looks like.
5955,Exactly only one on the stage and a mask on🙄not sure if I should take resources from this guy.
5956,Why is he wearing mask though !!???
5957,absolutely no clue
5958,There&#39;s something that i dont understand in the beginning of the video he explained that in the binary system u can count higher than 8 by adding another bit .. would that change the powers of each bit ? Like at first the one or zero to the left were powerd by 3 now we add another bit does that mean that its now 4 ?
5959,Loved it❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>I will cover it slowly
5960,Wow
5961,Triggered over a piece of cloth on someone&#39;s face LOL
5962,"Some people ask why he is wearing a mask, since it is basically useless.  It is virtue signalling."
5963,"I think this is the professor for people with short attention spans.  Perfect for the social media generation.  I&#39;m an outlier, but I would not want to sit in his class, it would wear me out.  After 5 minutes of watching, I felt like someone had been pounding on my head.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t have captions, so I couldn&#39;t turn the volume down and just read the text.  Still, kudos for putting this online, as it will help many people."
5964,Triggered over a piece of cloth on someone&#39;s face. LOL
5965,On a stage far away from everyone and wearing a face diaper? Seriously?
5966,Tem legendas para o português (Brasil - Brazil).
5967,My son uses scratch at school :D
5968,That thing on his face bugs
5969,do both
5970,Is there a particular advice on how to follow the course? I&#39;m on C block and I thinking maybe I should open VS and follow this or should I focus on just watching and there will be some kind of practical task later in this course?
5971,Why does he wear a mask being alone on the stage? It doesn&#39;t even filter.
5972,nice!
5973,"This is excellent to see available. Though, admittedly a bit hard to watch; I&#39;m feeling claustrophobic watching him speak and run out of breath in his mask."
5974,Thankyou
5975,this is supposed to be an introductory course. nb thinks otherwise
5976,"Seems to be very superficial stuff. It won&#39;t cover <i>everything.</i> It can&#39;t. You try condensing 3-4 years (hundreds of hours) into ~25h! I saw about 50 minutes of it and he just skipped over how negative numbers are represented with bits. Explaining how floating point numbers work would take an entire lecture.<br>So don&#39;t think of this as &quot;the ultimate course&quot;, or &quot;everything you need&quot;. It&#39;s not. It seems like a good course, but it&#39;s just 1 course. You should be getting your information from <i>multiple</i> sources. At some point it will start to click. Good luck with your studies!"
5977,And it changes with every lecture
5978,For those who want to know: the lamps on stage &quot;01001000 01001001 00100000 01001101 01001111 01001101 00000000 00000000&quot; say: &quot;hi mom&quot;.
5979,why wearing the mask?
5980,Thankyou.
5981,Did someone figured out that light bulbs on the scene is actually binary encoded message? :)
5982,W channel
5983,Just what I was looking for
5984,youtube reccomended moment
5985,"Watching this while being as a CS student, really tells me why Harvard has such a high reputation in the way they teach things in comparison with other Universities. Thanks for sharing this!"
5986,I have a program idea that would change the world 🌎.. <br>the pro. -it would make the world more efficient.  <br>The con. -it would eliminate a lot of jobs
5987,have you watched it?????
5988,Most ridiculous and pointless course ever (I mean… Scratch?!?!?!).<br><br>And the music: horrible and irritating.
5989,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=1h36m13s"">1:36:13</a>"
5990,Appreciated
5991,big ups for uploading a <b>1 day</b> long video
5992,Lol Good Luck whoever decides to spend 24hrs listening to this guy mumble through a dirty sock.
5993,Watching this in one day
5994,Worth it paying for the certification guys? I&#39;m loving it.
5995,It was filmed in 2021. There was probably a mandate to wear a mask regardless of what you&#39;re were doing.
5996,Why is he wearing a mask considering it does nothing and he is on stage by himself!!!
5997,who else high asf rn
5998,sure an interesting video. The face mask is a pain though .
5999,"There can&#39;t really be a good reason why there isn&#39;t at least one fan pointing at this guy, I would be fine with there being a little bit of white noise. He looks like he&#39;s on fire."
6000,"Wow I can’t wait to watch this, SAVED!"
6001,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRubcjpTkks"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRubcjpTkks</a>"
6002,"Is It just me, but when hearing everything explained so quickly and rapidly for the first time, I don&#39;t think I could teach this to someone else instead. I&#39;m nervous I might not be smart enough for this type of stuff. I start @ University of the People in about two days. I&#39;m also not good at math :(."
6003,хотів щось сказати про 10-ти годинну версію..але...
6004,I saw CSGO
6005,what to do after completing this course
6006,"Menos mal que tiene barbijo, hay mucha gente en ese escenario"
6007,Why does he like Ryan Gosling
6008,"No Mask, No Mask."
6009,Which district plz
6010,I&#39;m really proud to join this particular computer program course free of cost...huge respect to channel and salute to professor for this beautiful teaching...from my country Nepal 🇳🇵❤
6011,What a pleasant gesture.
6012,"In 2021, many places mandated that you wear a mask at all times when on site."
6013,wearing a mask if you&#39;re alone on a stage like this is stupid.
6014,holy hell that face covering is distracting.
6015,"1 day worth of Computer Science Lesson, Mad Respect for this Dude."
6016,This is officially the longest video I have ever watched! <br>(silly comment to feed the algorithm that this is great content)
6017,Talking about science but still wears a facediaper.... how ironic...
6018,Why is he wearing a mask? There is noone around him
6019,"Hello, banana   Hilarous!! xD"
6020,oa.
6021,Is this going to stay forever? I’m willing to learn this whole video
6022,This is why you didn&#39;t go to Harvard.
6023,"Anyone wearing a useless cloth mask on a distanced stage while lecturing is not on my list of reliable sources.  My problem, I know. But someone has to call this idiocy out."
6024,I love the power he has!
6025,"So I&#39;m interested in starting to learn computer science so as someone who starts from 0, is this video good to watch or do you need knowledge of computer science before watching this?"
6026,This is amazing that you share this valuable course for free! thanks a lot for ur efforts
6027,I don&#39;t know how I got here... wanna hug my friends  \ (•◡•) /
6028,"I appreciate this free 24 hour educational video, but I’m finding it hard to watch a guy in a mask in a room full of puppets."
6029,I thought of watching this faster by increasing the speed and realized he speaks so fast that I can&#39;t understand what he says if it goes faster lol
6030,Guys what is the best book or free course to learn computer architecture?<br><br>Thanks
6031,"As someone who has a MSCS degree, at great cost I might add, love the fact these are being offered for free."
6032,"Never seen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=1h00m51s"">1:00:51</a>:37 watch time ... Great Work"

6039,Thank you freecodecamp ❤️
6040,The videos are quite blurry
6041,this professor is great at public speaking
6042,Reported that video to yt so the person who has to watch it learns something
6043,"@Pranav Ahuja Tbh with his mentality, he probs doesn&#39;t even know what a computer is or what computer science is lol."
6044,you dont even deserve to listen to him
6045,Sad man
6046,Not going to listen to anyone wearing a mask
6047,thanks a lot to share your knowledge to the world
6048,Thank you to everyone behind the release of this video on YouTube for free. Life changing opportunity.
6049,I can&#39;t believe US universities still have mask mandates. The mass psychosis promoted by American institutions is unreal.
6050,Huge respect.
6051,CS50 presented by an enthusiastic speaker and in an incredibly well produced format?<br><br>For free?<br><br>From Harvard?<br><br>Let me just get a cuppa tea and we&#39;ll get started.

6053,"내가 컴퓨터에 들어갔을 때, 나는 프로그래밍을 배우기로 결심했고, 하드웨어와 운영 체제, 서버, 데이터베이스를 다루는 기술과 네트워크 통신을 맡았다. 일단 만족하면 나는 현장 기술자로서 일을 맡았고, 그곳에서 은행, 보험 회사, 정부 기관 등을 위한 모든 인프라를 배치했다. 제가 많은 분야에서 그런 일을 하게 된 이유는 단순히 IT의 한 측면을 배우는 것을 넘어섰기 때문이라고 생각합니다. 즉, 컴퓨터 세계의 여러 분야에서 문제를 해결할 수 있는 충분한 지식이 없어도 해결책을 효율적으로 찾을 수 있는 방법을 알고 있다는 것을 충분히 이해하고 싶어하는 태도를 길렀습니다. 누구에게 전화해야 할지 알고 있었다.<br>당신이 할 수 있는 한 많이 배우는 것은 당신의 시간을 들일 가치가 있다. 결국, 당신은 좋은 보상을 받을 것이다."
6054,"When I got into computers I decided to learn programming, then took on network and communication, technical which covered hardware, operating systems, servers and databases. Once I was satisfied I took on a job as a field technician where I deployed all the infrastructure for banks, insurance companies, government agencies and more. I feel the reason I got to do that type of work in so many areas is due to the fact I went beyond just learning one aspect of IT. In other words I developed an attitude of wanting to have enough of an understanding in different branches of the computer world that even if I didn&#39;t know enough to fix a problem, I knew how to efficiently find the solution. I knew who to call.<br>It&#39;s worth your while to learn as much as you can. In the end, you will be well compensated"
6055,To spent life in watching and writing all this comands? Man..... life is absolute oposite.
6056,"His enthusiasm makes any potentially boring subject very exciting, all while sounding like 2x at a &quot;normal&quot; playback speed :)"
6057,i was at 11 hours before i realized the audience was puppets
6058,1% of this course maybe is &quot;computer science&quot;.
6059,thank you
6060,So can I earn a degree after watching this video??
6061,Am I the only who was dumbly enthusiastic to think that it is only one hour?
6062,bro if only my cs classes where like this.
6063,"hey, are those lightbulbs binary?"
6064,Thanks for the free content. Love it. But why the mask in this case? 🤔
6065,"This is just amazing, it&#39;s strange coz i never imagined i would be here having learnt cybersecurity without stepping into a college classroom..am really grateful to freecodecamp and just as you have helped me am also helping others by giving out this knowledge on my YouTube channel &#39;G-SECURITY&#39;..let&#39;s teach the world."
6066,"Walks with a muzzle on his face in an empty room, totally out of mind."
6067,why the mask clearly having a difficult time breathing lol
6068,"Huge resoect! Two years later, I&#39;ll be a different person who may land his first job in the IT industry! I&#39;ll come back to check this comment again."
6069,hate the mask
6070,This guy has got to be on SPEED !
6071,🤯
6072,I know what I&#39;m doing tonight
6073,Wow!<br>Very explosive intro🔥🔥
6074,Recorded in 2021. Masks were probably still mandated if you were on site (regardless of what you were doing).
6075,"I wonder why it wears that masks if he speaks that much, let alone he is so far from students."
6076,"I have only watched 5 minutes, but he has already perfectly described what it is like to be a programmer, as well as explaining things I wish I had heard from my teachers at the start of university."
6077,"Wearing a mask on stage, alone, retard."
6078,This goes to show how much of a rip off college really is. Charging 2000 to 4000 for one course when you can get the same stuff for nearly free shows you that &quot;higher education&quot; is a wage slave trap to make you an indentured servant.<br><br>Decentralized education WILL BE the great leveler in the 21st Century. No longer will people be forced into indentured servitude &quot;just to get a good job&quot;

6080,This course is losing credibility given the prof is wearing that MASK.
6081,Why are you wearing a mask?
6082,Done !!! 😊💯<br>Thank you Dr. David. Great work !!!  <br>👏👏👏
6083,So happy that Ryan Reynolds is teaching me CS
6084,"Damn, I was coming in for a Harvard CSGO course. What did I get myself into this time?"
6085,why is he wearing a mask on stage
6086,"why is he wearing a mask? disliked, reported and i will not watch your video. thanks and have a nice day."
6087,:)
6088,"I studied IT in NZ for 4 years, this will be an interesting comparison, because we use the CompTIA structure, I did A+ and N+"
6089,hi
6090,Bruh I clicked on this thinking the title said &quot;Harvard CSGO&quot;
6091,Nobody became computer scientist after watching this course.
6092,"Can’t watch, his face mask is too distracting🤦🏻‍♂️"
6093,This job market is about to become oversaturated... because everyone wants to make a lot of money from just sitting on their butts and typing code.
6094,"What a thorough and in-depth course, thank you so much for posting this!"
6095,"The lamps on stage visible in his first lecture (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=8m06s"">8:06</a>) read out &quot;HI MOM&quot; in binary.<br>Nice detail"
6096,i really thought they was teaching csgo strats at harvard ngl
6097,"hello, I just stumbled upon this video, does someone know if anyone can use edx to participate and do work? im currently an hour in and this seems like it will help me with my learning in college, im an aspiring computer science major"
6098,Sweet mask
6099,OMG..if only we had more of these back then and I had enough time to study instead of working a lot :( Thank you soo so much.
6100,Amazing that this content is free - there is hope for the world yet! Thanks!
6101,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=11h03m08s"">11:03:08</a> is it a red box that you see?"
6102,Wearing a mask on an empty stage well over 2ft from any other person. Sounds about right for the average campus progressive lmao
6103,This 4K 1-day-long video must&#39;ve legit taken nearly a week to upload to YouTube.. at least 2 days!!
6104,"Ah yes the course that got me properly started on my journey into programming. I remember after a while I took part in a code golf thread on 4chan&#39;s technology board, the topic was text to ASCII code converters and I won by a landslide. Code golf is a game, not development, it&#39;s important to remember that. Yet these people were writing neat and very readable code, and that&#39;s how you lose :)<br><br><br>Their submissions were all between 15-50 lines. I simply posted:<br><br>for(int x;x=getchar();printf(&quot;%d &quot;, x)); <br><br>They complained so hard, that it&#39;s ugly, that it abuses the language (because they don&#39;t understand how it works... I&#39;ll explain later), that it didn&#39;t compile correctly on their obscure compiler, that I &quot;incorrectly used the for() loop&quot;, that it doesn&#39;t count as a full program because it doesn&#39;t include all of the code needed to run it, so I fixed it:<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include"">#include</a> &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>int main(){for(int x;x=getchar();printf(&quot;%d &quot;, x)); }<br><br>And they were somehow even more angry, but even though they tried to deny it, I won the game. It was a very memorable, beautiful moment.<br><br>For all the newbies learning from this video, it&#39;s an extremely simple program:<br>The for() loop keeps my program running until you exit.<br>I define a variable I called x and assign it to the &quot;get character&quot; function in the standard library.<br>By outputting the input as a number, you receive the corresponding ASCII code of that character or string.<br><br>And that&#39;s it, you can type a single character or a full paragraph then hit enter and boom, it display the code(s) and stays running, awaiting more input until you exit. <br>It works flawlessly without a single error in the compiler. Anyways, that&#39;s how I won at code golf and made a lot of people very upset."
6105,this is how education at all countries should be.
6106,@John Smith lmao.. I&#39;ve never heard &quot;jocose&quot; till this fantastic dude used the word here.. I&#39;m not a native English speaker so...
6107,You should teach us about English.
6108,"tell me you&#39;re an english major without telling me you&#39;re an english major<br><br>zealous, jocose, rudimentary"
6109,"I majored in English Education and I&#39;ve never thought before that listening to lecture related to computer science, which seemed a totally distant area that I would never be accessible and comprehensible forever with my prior knowledge can be so simple like this. He is such a great educator with zealous speech and jocose materials. As a cyber audience, I could absorb the rudimentary knowledge relating to computer science and as an English Teacher in a private academy I could be inspired a lot by his way of conveying the sophisticated knowledge of certain field in such an attention-grabbing manner."
6110,I remember using Scratch in the 8th grade in extended learning opportunities class. I made a Mario style platforming game. I even arranged the music myself by changing the Mario theme song slightly.  Really cool stuff!
6111,I never thought I would hear Emojis as a topic in a course about computer science.
6112,"If we call ‘malloc’, we should call ‘free’. It seems very important and i am not understanding why cant this be automated as it seems so easy to do…. Can someone explain?"
6113,This teacher is very good at being precise with his words to produce clear explanations and examples.
6114,whoaaa epic!!!
6115,This is like a dream 😭 Can we get a certificate from completing this ? lol
6116,thanks
6117,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=56m25s"">56:25</a> you say random numbers are great for a game.

6119,"Can&#39;t say the best course as it can&#39;t match iit bombay, iiit Hyderabad Or iit madras level lol. Pretty less competitive. But for sure a great free course"
6120,The trick is to look it up on stack overflow.
6121,"Intro song name, anyone?"
6122,I would say &quot;This is cs50&quot; but I guess time to find out
6123,The stage lights are binary right? What do they mean?
6124,Thanks a lot man! it&#39;s really helpful for me as new student in Computer Science 🙏

6126,i cant watch this. im out of breath
6127,finna do a full computer science marathon with the boys

6131,@Islam Abukoush who isn’t there? 😅
6132,@Batwam thats what &quot;he&quot; said...  he never spoke any words after it... in fact he wasn&#39;t there anymore to do it...
6133,@Batwam 😂
6134,"@Jack Yeah that happens when one is talking university and the other is thinking worldview. But then again, maybe you&#39;re commenting on the wrong video. FYI we are on a CS50 course discussion here..."
6135,@Spooky Action at a Distance not so comfortable with the English language though given the incoherence of your reply.
6136,24 hours of Harvard Computer Science for free??? Huge respect
6137,I did all but the last three items in college but was never paid for any of it from anyone. Rejection has hurt my motivation but I&#39;m pushing forward anyway. I&#39;m here to push my motivation some more on the positive end so I can be more creative because depending on someone else to provide any support will never work. I really do love working with binary math. It is so logical making complete sense more than any other function or language.
6138,all and nothing at once
6139,Wearing a mask on stage with nobody near you in front of stuffed animals. The dog leash is real with these nerds.
6140,bruh I thought it said Harvard CSGO
6141,Kudos 🎉 to freeCodeCamp for all the things they do to provide free and high quality education to everyone!
6142,Ecouter des cours fait par des gens qui portent des masques comme des débiles laisse tomber !!!!
6143,"Folks, we&#39;re in the golden age of free information!"
6144,scratch boi in the back
6145,macher wer das durch schaut
6146,DU MACHER
6147,Good sheet 5 update from colleagues.
6148,Wow that&#39;s awesome
6149,"think i can skip the lecture on C? as in do successive lectures depend on it? i don&#39;t want to waste time learning C, python is my preference"
6150,oh my god i thought CS50 said CSGO and i was like &quot;harvard has a course for CSGO ?&quot;
6151,Great course! A compsci course on algorithmic problem solving could really do without the bit about lobbying the emoji comittee. for social issues.
6152,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=5h24m00s"">5:24:00</a> why he wearing a mask"
6153,"This is so good, it feels like I&#39;m watching the latest Apple Keynote for Developers"
6154,ain t no way bro explained CS for 1 day straight
6155,Can you edit the mask away? It is too much to look this nervous presentation without seeing his face.
6156,Thank you for this content! What is with the puppets in the front rows??
6157,kids who paid to go to Harvard
6158,"Great course information but my guy needs to really take off the mask. At this point, this is just plain insanity, he&#39;s on a big stage, with  front rows being incredibly far away from him. Keep in mind the all mighty &quot;shots&quot; being here and he still pretending he is in the appocolyse."
6159,"Just started the CS50X introduction to computer science course as a complete beginner.<br><br>Day 1: <a href=""https://youtu.be/IB97phdY7hQ"">https://youtu.be/IB97phdY7hQ</a>"
6160,he&#39;s leaking harvard
6161,You can you  use making playlist?
6162,"First of all: A HUGE THANK YOU for @freecodeCamp and Harvard. <br>I&#39;m an Art Major and always wanted to go into Computer Science but have been told repeatedly not to waste my time, and that its not what you think it is. <br>Yet here I am going: But, this feels like everything I thought it was. <br>FYI: I work in IT<br>Second: I wish YT had a way for me to bookmark where I was just at so its easier for me to get back to it. <br>(I know about the Share &gt; Start at button... but you know.. if there was a real way. 😥<br>(Anyway, made a note of it)"
6163,"huge respect to this guy for lecturing for an entire day, very impressive."
6164,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=0h7m31s"">0:7:31</a>"
6165,The mask really takes away from the visual performance.
6166,its good practice to use forms correctly for example required is an option so forms wont submit until you select an option this is much better then running code on a server for no reason!
6167,"this guy could of just swapped 2 lights instead of offing 1 and turning another on, is he autistic? lol"
6168,terrible writing code style i would of given -200 points for that bs! code(){<br>bla <br>} <br>is how code shpuld be structured! not {  on its own line like a moron!
6169,Doesn&#39;t want to give his computer covid lol
6170,Why is he on stage alone with a mask on?
6171,imagine living in Cambodia and get this for FREE! Thank you Harvard and especially David Malan &amp; Brian from whom I have learned much more than just programming. THIS has made my life better
6172,this channel is amazing

6175,I GOT LEARN MORE
6176,15 minutes in and he&#39;s soaking wet. He&#39;s getting wet on  comp sci
6177,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=27m00s"">27:00</a>"
6178,Thanks for this chennal
6179,He&#39;s up on a stage wearing a mask with puppets in the audience. Hard to take seriously.<br>This is also remedial content unsuitable for the university level which is explicitly indicated by the leading 0 of 050.
6180,😂 bros wearing a mask
6181,"Thats very nice of you introducing CS50 :). You are both rocks CS50 and freecodecamp ,thanks a lot for education !!!&lt;3"
6182,25 hours for this... what a waste of time!
6183,Man I haven&#39;t seen a more informative video since I saw Anime For You-sama make that video about the Simpsons. Subscribed!
6184,Many Many Thanks to freeCodeCamp and Harvard for making this amazing content available!
6185,At least you don&#39;t need to get the heart-inflaming shot to follow this course
6186,@prithivraj selvakumar Thanks ! I think it would be better to have it directly on the video progress bar.
6187,It’s there in the description. Check it..
6188,Could we have chapters in this long 24 hours video please ? :) Would be really helpfull for people viewing this during different days.
6189,"i just fell in love,with the content.what a gem"
6190,"Great course, but, why didn&#39;t he use a microphone?"
6191,I dont know how I saw CSGO in CS50......gotta get my eyes checked :)
6192,im gonna be honest i misread this as harvard CSGO
6193,"Professor: and if I turn this third light on, the number is?<br>Me: 3<br>Students: 7<br>Professor: ...7<br>Me: whelp..."
6194,I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;m a little disappointed. Thought this was Harvard CSGO.
6195,Please add Chapters to the video
6196,I&#39;ve never been more excited about a freecodecamp video !! Thank you for making this available for free !
6197,i thought it said Harvard CSGO
6198,HI MOM
6199,What did we ever do to deserve this amazing content? 😢
6200,@Kundaniel Œk yeah!
6201,Especially in 4K.
6202,I can&#39;t even imagine how long this took to render... Thank you a lot!
6203,Whoa! Dude just made 24 hours of video with that mask on and all that sweating while people couldn&#39;t wear their mask while buying a toilet paper.
6204,jai mahakal <br>like thoko guys
6205,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=2h29m41s"">2:29:41</a>"
6206,25h 💀
6207,like him with its mask damn i was sweating
6208,....He appears to be wearing a mask in an empty room filled with nothing but teddies who seem to be capable of conversing with him telepathically. <br> Either the muppets are using their covid downtime to expand their horizons or he&#39;s having a breakdown from being in lockdown for so long!<br><br> (In all seriousness I know there&#39;s some students further back &amp; have huge respect for this professor&#39;s genius &amp; engaging lectures!)
6209,"What, no GnuCOBOL ?"
6210,Hopefully we can all now admit that wearing a mask on a stage by yourself was peak stupid.
6211,Covid theater in 2022
6212,So useless spend of time
6213,It&#39;s so pathetic to see a smart person forced to obey the will of stupid people and forced to wear a mask like a slave.
6214,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=9h55m03s"">9:55:03</a> Let&#39;s kinda fckn take a look <br><br>LMAO"
6215,HI MOM
6216,"so far from the audience, but still wearing a mask.<br><br>if (!IsCloseToAudience()) { RemoveMask(); )"
6217,Want more like this ❤❤❤❤
6218,What is the fun of keeping respected silent students in the first rows.?
6219,"DO you believe this, i am somewhere in Africa and attend class in Harvard. This is insane!!! Txs freeodecampers !!"
6220,I completed this <br>but what abt the certificate?
6221,You are all absolutely fooking amazing! I LOVE FREE CODE CAMP you are HEROS! making this assessable is saintly! Thank you!!!!
6222,why bro got a mask on😐
6223,Huge respect to you <br>Teaching so good wearing mask <br>That&#39;s too difficult
6224,Just wanna say Thank you so much!
6225,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=19h32m49s"">19:32:49</a>"

6227,"So much sympathy for students and teachers during pandemic.  Not sure I would’ve been able to comply to the mask policy.  I can see it being both mentally and physically draining.  If you’re someone who managed to get through it, I solute you and hope you’re in a much better spot now.  You deserve it."
6228,People used to make fun of people with schizophrenia.   You know the tin foil hats because they didn&#39;t want someone or the govt.  sending mind control rays at their brain.  But when a guy has a mask on his face for some virus that could possibly in the air everyone pretends like it is perfectly normal.   It&#39;s not normal.
6229,I used to think programs could be written with lego blocks.  Visually put the peices together.  It works ok for buttons and other things to have building blocks.  But think of a story a writer writes.  Not too many could be put together that way. But you can use templates for a starting point.
6230,"So you are giving a public speech, alone,  on stage and need to wear a mask?  Is this guy a germ phobe or does he really believe there are viruses floating around everywhere?"
6231,system.out.print
6232,Yeah! Computer science from a guy with two Macbooks - definitely a good course. Very like)
6233,I WANNA LEARN BUT IT JUST DOESNT STICK.
6234,I love how he talks to the first rows of muppets xD
6235,"Literally just wanted something educational to watch about computer science. FUCKING A FOR GIVING ME THE WHOLE THING🎉. I already have an associates and this is so fuckin helpful and clear, and much more languages than ive learned in my wchoo"
6236,Thanks a lot ~;
6237,"@DAHoppin if you&#39;re gonna finish your BA, id recommend getting your Comptia Sec+ &amp; CISM, and you&#39;re set for any Cybersecurity Analyst job. From there, CISSP would probably be your next go before you get another big pay bump. Really just depends on what you want to do in Cybersec, so research the ISACA &amp; COMPTIA certs for sure."
6238,"@ODYSY Could you get into cybersecurity as someone in their second year of Cs?, if so is there any clue on how?"
6239,@Jacob Booth Pretty much either software engineering or academia. Within software engineering there are a bunch of different paths you could take.
6240,what career options are available by taking the route of computer science ?
6241,"I skimmed through the topics here, and as a CS grad myself I have to say this is a pretty forward thinking way of teaching an introductory CS class. Most intro CS classes just use one language and focus of the standard data structures, algorithms, and coding skills. This gives you exposure to all these topics while still covering the fundamentals."
6242,If there&#39;s a timestamp.. kinda lost progress gradually in the middle of the course
6243,The mask is so pointless and stupid.
6244,i got confused for a minute when the muppets showed up out of nowhere
6245,why this video is glitching  &amp; not play  <br>smoothly 🤔
6246,I don&#39;t understand that it is still ongoing how is it available? Or am I watching a different CS50?
6247,So much Aderol at work here!
6248,he should take off this damn mask. he cant even breathe
6249,why is he teaching an audience of muppets?
6250,This mask is stressing me out.

6265,@msgesus because i can
6266,@felina Why
6267,@msgesus yes i did
6268,No you didn&#39;t
6269,i watched the whole thing in 1 sitting very worth it
6270,@the dude ???
6271,it&#39;s scripted
6272,wow. this is so well done. great teacher and videography! amazing questions and answers and pace of teaching. i love this!
6273,"I don&#39;t care how educated you are, walking around on a stage all by yourself whilst sweating yourself to death and still wearing a face mask is kinda dumb"
6274,Surely this will be revealed later in the presentation...<br>HI MOM..
6275,Hugh respect for the school and lecturer. Much thanks from Singapore.
6276,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=2h00m14s"">2:00:14</a> are those teddy bears watching ?"
6277,how old are the students ?
6278,i am going to watch this with absolutely no clue about anything in programming lmao
6279,I cant watch him with this mask of django
6280,Reallly? A Mask?
6281,@Chris M Could&#39;ve made the same argumentation throughout history when anything first given towards nobility was handed down to any class lower than them.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t believe you were serious when writing this.
6282,@Lee R. Watson skipped the logical conclusion of what would happen if every student did what you did
6283,"@Chris M lol, cry me a river"
6284,"@Kirk the Jerk Plenty of education is already taxpayer funded. I don’t want people obtaining my same qualifications for free, after I’ve paid tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br>All this does is devalue my degree and lower my ability to negotiate a higher salary for myself. What gives anyone the right to devalue my degree?"
6285,"Yeah, paying teachers is stupid! Food should be free too. People gotta eat! Screw the farmers! Everything should be free!"
6286,Education should be free and accessible for everyone. Huge respect to this channel!!!
6287,Malan is a little sweaty but I love the dude. He seems so passionate about the subject and clearly puts a lot of effort in which I love. (Now if only my lecturers cared beyond the paycheck...)
6288,"I wonder how much size is of this video, huge respect for this guy.."
6289,Why release a lecture with the mask? It disrupts everything good.
6290,Bro they even got the professional cinematographers
6291,Wonder how long it took to upload over a day of 4K footage
6292,AKA
6293,3 hours in and I&#39;m just now seeing the stuffed animals lol
6294,lel
6295,My parents will be proud of me. I can now tell them I attended Harvard university .
6296,glad i live in an era where ivy league education is freely published to the internet
6297,This is a university level course? FML we got taught most of this stuff in highschool. A masters really is worth less than the paper it is printed on....

6307,No
6308,please reply

6318,finished the first module. going to try to finish this course in two weeks
6319,This looks very very basic. Is this like a course to non-technical people that want to get into programming ?
6320,"They should rename it to &quot;Introduction to Database Programming&quot;, computer science my ass.  Not once did they mention clock timings or data bus logic.  What a joke."
6321,To keep the media made panicking Californians under control. Just my guess
6322,why is he wearing a mask?
6323,Super extreme harvardcoke there
6324,Can’t believe he wore a mask by himself on the stage for the lecture

6339,Mark Rober energy! &lt;3
6340,"I am 10 minutes into this. Right now, I am really hoping that the reason he is &#39;the best&#39; is not just because he is walking around and yelling. Not that that is a bad thing, but I hope it is more than that! I am speaking on behalf of all introverted and soft-spoken instructors. hahaha. In an era where the attention span is at an all time low (need to do a study to verify) I can see why his approach is pertinent! I will watch the rest and update if I am wrong."
6341,The guy wearing a mask alone makes me think this lesson is completely dumb lol

6378,"Great Course, lots to learn.<br>He should have worn a brighter shirt."
6379,Wow... This I just came across a Free 24hours+ video?..... Just mind-blowing...
6380,"Этот учебный курс Гарвардского Университета по CS (Компьютерным Наукам) хороший, но я еще раз убедился, что для изучения лекции важно, не только содержание курса, но и то, как читает его лектор и кто читает. Быстрый разговор и ношение защитной маски от вирусов, когда уже нет &quot;пандемии&quot; указывает на невротичность лектора. А лектор невротик психологически отрицательно влияет на студентов, не говоря о том, что эффект обучения у него низок. Мой совет, смотря этот курс, включите субтитры и останавливая это видео, чтобы прочесть фрагменты субтитров, читайте их."
6381,This channel is going beyond an NGO
6382,Respect level 3000!
6383,"Your Species has a Choice to Make?<br>Every Swine in France, Checkoslovakia, Romania, Alaska, Rwanda and North Korea is gonna have his head Smashed in. Your Universities are a Charade. You Teach at Too high a level. So, only those that Already know it Understand it. Harvard charges $40,000 a Year. So if a Student can&#39;t Program then he&#39;s gonna want his Money back. So you do Teach them, just a Language that Industry doesn&#39;t use.<br>When, they go for a Job and Realise they can&#39;t. Then you tell them, &quot;Designed in America, built in India&quot;. Then you tell them they learned Design Skills. Then tell them to Pay an Indian.<br>I&#39;m a Cat, Not a P1G like you. There isn&#39;t Anything you can Teach me."
6384,wow
6385,Actually great for you guys to add more exposure to these videos :)
6386,Just a suggestion to everyone DONT SKIP JUST TO WHERE HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT SCRATCH INSTEAD FIRST WATCH THE STARTING IT WILL TELL YOU HOW COMPUTERS ACTUALLY WORKS AND EVENTUALLY HE ALSO STATED A ALGORITHM FOR YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT
6387,just love this channel as a computer science student

6398,That is how they teach at Harvard? He speaks too fast plus he is in hurry.
6399,It would be good to split this 25 hour video into chapters I think?
6400,why did he wear mask? lol
6401,I guess i have something to watch for a couple months xd
6402,Get a cs degree you bandwagons
6403,Cringe

6409,"super course, thank you so much."
6410,"Why not stick around for all of it? I mean it’s technically a free Harvard education. You can always go back to the big 3 when you want, but it doesn’t hurt to learn more."
6411,"Hello everyone, please tell me if I should watch the whole course if I am now focused more on learning the frontend, or if I should watch only the part that deals with HTML, CSS, and JS? Thank you for your work freeCodeCamp!"

6429,"The mask is absurd at this point in this in the pandemic, especially while he&#39;s alone on stage presenting for a video that will likely be seen several million times. If this were mid 2020 it&#39;d be less insane. But this is just craziness."

6438,"I am from a non-tech background and frankly, I don&#39;t understand the lecture from the beginning. am I too dumb?  i want to learn programming but it does not make any sense to me , do i need to know maths to be grasp it?"
6439,Wow I&#39;m just starting to learn some serious programming. And this could not have come at a better time.<br>Thanks!

6444,is it a good idea if Im in highschool and watch this? Im probably going to have a go at computer science

6453,He looks very funny in this muzzle. A freak virus may have infected the cameras. 😂
6454,Thanks!
6455,really 24 hours?
6456,the fact he still uses C as intro and not pythong or JS shows Havard still did not understand how to teach people tech. Take a look at MIT and really refresh your courses. What is shown here is 1980 and not 2022.
6457,This is not computer sience this is just the branch of programming and matematics
6458,@Jay O you&#39;re*
6459,Your just lazy
6460,"@Marco Aurelio if you actually read the comment, that&#39;s not at all what I said. also not sure if you went to college, but usually courses like this take a semester, or a few months to complete."
6461,It took you months to finish this? 😅
6462,yeah stats is really boring (unless you&#39;re a boring person).
6463,"I graduated over a year ago from university with a stats degree. Going to lectures was boring and not engaging at all, I feel like I learned nothing despite sitting through 100s of hours of lectures. Now, I&#39;m sitting here on my own time choosing to watch this. It feels like I can watch through this entire thing over the course of a few months. Really shows how important it is to have good lecturers for learning"

6470,"I don&#39;t mean to sound ungrateful. In fact, I am very grateful for these great free learning resources. Still, the instructor muzzled, in spite of being alone on stage, and the closest students are stuffed dolls, shows the absolute state of American universities. At the same time, the muzzling makes it harder to understand for non-native English speakers."

6473,I thought it is a Harvard CSGO tournament
6474,"For in-depth knowledge, I recommend getting a good 400 page book on C++ or Java or JavaScript, or web development (CSS, JavaScript, HTML). Otherwise, you will be googling for solutions to very simple problems."

6493,I’m just starting the video are there any prerequisite?
6494,Thankyou💙💙💙💙

6501,"@Tom K Thanks, man. In FreeCodeCamp I did the Responsive Web Design and the Javascript and Data Structures one, from there I did some of the Michael Harlt courses, he has a monthly subscription that gives you access to of a lot of excellent books that he wrote.

6522,"This is not a great way to learn anything, in my opinion.<br><br>The best starting point is picking a language (doesn&#39;t matter, just pick one), and going through the documentation. All languages have excellent docs, especially these days, with &quot;Getting Started&quot; sections and guided tutorials.<br><br>Having a &quot;professor&quot; relay that information to you is not remotely as conducive to learning the concepts properly as reading it yourself, at your own pace, and being hands on with code at the same time.<br><br>Sorry to burst any bubbles, but people have been learning to code since World War 2, and they didn&#39;t have colleges or universities available to teach them."

6538,Isn&#39;t this theft? It&#39;s a paid course right? Just uploading a paid course for free 8s like pirating. I thought this channel was respectful of original authors. 🥺
6539,why the hell does he wear a mask when there is literally no one even close to him. seeing him like this just makes me feel like i am chocking struggling to breath instead of him.
6540,I have nothing else to say but thank you. You are rock stars ❤💥👏
6541,Is there any version without a mask on?
6542,too much stressful and verbose speech...

6552,Yea never trust statics they just eat nunbers but doesn&#39;t give insights
6553,Same thing in my country
6554,"David sir is so energetic and really explains topics very deep, thanks FreeCodeCamp and Harvard University for providing this quality education content for free. FreeCodeCamp is really democratizing learning to code. Here in India, We don&#39;t have good teachers and there are some teachers like CodeWithHarry and others that teach coding online, but our college education is really outdated and has expensive course fees. Due to that, I&#39;m self-teaching myself to code and these materials really help. Here in India we produce too many computer science grads but they lack even sometimes basic coding knowlegde and only just degree holder without any actual problem solving skills. Again, Kudos to FreeCodeCamp!"
6555,Massive thanks for this course. I just love listening to this man explain stuff. It&#39;s insane how good he is at transferring knowledge.
6556,"Thank you, FreeCodeCamp, for not only providing this courses accessible for everyone, but also for combining it in very good structure. Also big appreciation for Harvard CS50 for allowing rest of us chance to access these kind of resources."
6557,Thank you so much for providing free education.
6558,The most exciting lecture introduction ever. So inspiring!
6559,"Was the mask necessary? He&#39;s on stage, by himself..."
6560,"Mom: &quot;It&#39;s late honey, time to sleep&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Just one video mom and I go to bed&quot;<br>The one video:"

6562,Do anyone know how can I get notes
6563,"They do share their lesson freely, MIT, London Business School, Havard etc it is all on their websites or Youtube, Edx Coursera. Even paid ones can be learn for free using audit track."
6564,"I want that all biggest universities record their lessons and share it to other students freely. In order to, those who can&#39;t afford to go to college they use these contents because knowledge should be free."
6565,"no, there are several parts that are merged."
6566,Bro.. The guy really stood there for 24hours to teach CS50?
6567,I&#39;m going to complete this for sure
6568,good for beginners I guess
6569,💕
6570,ขอบคุณมากๆนะครับเป็นประโยชน์มากๆครับ🙇🏻💕
6571,Good job.
6572,"freeCodeCamp is doing an amazing job<br>I just want to thank everyone in freeCodeCamp for providing so many good courses , pls continue the good work we&#39;ll support you as much as we can"
6573,1 glaring problem is no chapter / not broken up by segments.
6574,Thank you so much.
6575,Thank you so much !!! Love this channel .
6576,Free Code Camp is just too good haha
6577,"Brazil here, Thank you!!!"
6578,Do they mention the books or documents needed?
6579,I thought this video was 1 hour long until I realized the 1 is in days
6580,This is a great course and I am very thankful for all the people who put an effort on this course.
6581,"Poor guy, sounds like he was not getting enough oxygen because of that mask.  Thank you for this content."
6582,Asking. If i need more understanding about Javascript... Do i have to watch all courses or just the part of Javascript?

6585,Omg. Bless this channel 🙏❤
6586,"Quick question, would this be better than the ones about DSA from years ago?"
6587,"I was epecting a dull, dry lecture series, but this guy presents it with a lot of energy, and not gonna lie, the visual and auditory cues really engage my ADHD brain.  I literally sat up in my chair when he tore that phone book in half to demo logorithmic algorithms :D"
6588,like wdf!
6589,"nevermind, spoke too soon"
6590,"timestamps, anyone?"
6591,Annnndddddd now I want to read Harry Potter again

6597,I&#39;ve to slow it down to 0.75 😄
6598,Can I get some online certificate for completing this course
6599,Really? This dude really gonna wear a mask when recording a 24hour Harvard lecture in 2022?! Dude just gonna muffle his way through an intro class where he should be teaching fundamentals?! smh
6600,Those masks...
6601,I was looking for cricket but im staying for the code
6602,This is beautiful!. Thank You
6603,Any course is enough to get you started really. Just a matter of what you do with the courses and how you apply it afterwards. <br><br>But to answer your question: Absolutely
6604,Is that course Enough to let you get started with  the programming world??<br>Please any answers ?
6605,"Reaching 1 hr, and it is just a GREAT course..."
6606,10 years in programming and still feel awe looking at the clarity and enthusiasm of the instructor. Love of programming personified. Its unfortunate to have his mask on all the time. Guru 🙏
6607,"thank you so much, soon i will make to you a donation because without  you i can&#39;t have access to all i have to learn. Blessings for you, thank you"
6608,Thank you sooooooo much 🤗
6609,Thank you for sharing this!!!
6610,THANKS!!!!
6611,That intro though....is this a Westworld episode?
6612,Sir please make Harvard Business course 🙏🙏
6613,Wow I am so thankful to FreeCodeCamp to make this couse available online. Thank you for giving a kid from a third world country a level playing field.
6614,grateful
6615,"Thank you, this is incredible content!"
6616,I must be the only person that doesn&#39;t like this course
6617,Thank you so much for these videos.
6618,This is not the future....this is the present....colleges are overrated and only making money institutes....this could have happened years ago..
6619,Thank you for this video! 🙏
6620,I request to the Channel to bring more courses like this.
6621,how lucky is that am watching this course of Harvard for free and any time anywhere. Thanks for freeCodeCamp and really love it ._ from Pakistan
6622,Why does he need this mask on his face????
6623,"Huge respect folks, Well done and thanks for the great work"
6624,Currently taking this course; Sir David is a legend. The problem sets and labs are wonderful ways to (get inspiration or) solve real word problems.
6625,I can&#39;t find the words to describe how amazing this is
6626,Thankyou so much!
6627,I&#39;m currently watching... I&#39;ll assume I&#39;m at Harvard.
6628,I wanted to know if freecodecamp will release updated material for machine learing in quantitative analysis and/or algorithmic trading.
6629,Thank you for sharing the course at this platform. Freecodecamp is awesome!
6630,His muzzle is lovely! No bit lost.
6631,Respect For You Sir
6632,Wooowwww....this is great content
6633,THANK YOU freeCodeCamp! Prof Malan you are amazing!
6634,If any one completed this course comment
6635,"well, not accessible to deaf people because of this stupid mask thing, they ruined it"
6636,This is simply AMAZING. Making high quality education accessible to the masses.<br>How absolutely wonderful. :)
6637,Thought this said harvard csgo... just wasted 24 hours just to find out this isnt about harvards csgo team.. :/
6638,Cybersecurity section doesn&#39;t seems to have audio in it.
6639,If only you had a way to find that out yourself...
6640,is this 24 hour 54 minutes and 37 seconds long video?
6641,THX!
6642,You open your mouth and speak like thousands do every single day. How do you think without a brain?
6643,How can you teach effectively wearing a face muzzle?
6644,Great! I&#39;m actually following this year&#39;s lectures and loving it
6645,Thank you! I will save and like this. Only now I will procrastinate until motivated to do so. Which I’m lying to myself that I need motivation.
6646,Thank you so much
6647,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=11m11s"">11:11</a><br>Ignore this"
6648,@BurnLikeAFlame pile of unused neurons and water
6649,"Wait... are you saying that you played a 24-hour video, at 2x, and it took 12 hours? I wonder if there&#39;s math to determine that without even watching..."
6650,watched this on 2x  still took me half a day
6651,@Aritra Bag Ohhh. Sorry!
6652,"@Tawfik Hossain I completed this course from EdX  bro!<br>Moreover now 2022 version available(where Malan Sir didn&#39;twear mask),  this one is 2021."
6653,@Tawfik Hossain he said he completed day one which is of 1 hour.
6654,I&#39;m amazed that I already completed a full 1 day 1 hr. course!!!! Wow! Hats off to me🙂
6655,@BurnLikeAFlame Excuse me? :P I don&#39;t need to show you a medical degree to say that a mask isn&#39;t necessary.
6656,@Daniel Jeffery Show me your medical degree or remain silent.
6657,@BurnLikeAFlame What does it matter whether it&#39;s a Harvard video?<br><br>There&#39;s no reason to wear a mask if you&#39;re nowhere near anyone else.
6658,Commenting like a moron on a Harvard-related video? Are you ****ing serious?
6659,Wearing a mask when he&#39;s by himself? Are you ****ing serious?
6660,why is this guy wearing a mask alone on stage...🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
6661,I love you guys
6662,"Truly Elegant, like always. FreeCodeCamp + cs50 rocks !!!!🤩"
6663,"Omg, this is what they teach in Harvard 🤦🏼‍♂️"
6664,🙏
6665,Show us what you&#39;ve done to educate society. We&#39;ll wait.
6666,He is wearing a mask in an auditorium of puppets? and this is a harvard lecture?
6667,"OMG, I studied 5 years in the University, and it is only 24 hours video)))) haha"
6668,This is the first time ever I felt like commenting my gratitude on a video. Respect for you all guys 🙏
6669,"WOW, this is CS50"
6670,Thank you !!
6671,Thank you very much for combining it into a single lecture. It reduces a lot of hassle.
6672,Thanks for organizing this! (One video) 👍🙏
6673,FINNA SPEEDRUN COMPUTER SCIENCE!
6674,Teachers like David can compel you to fall in love with the course you hate the most.

6679,Thank you for providing this to everyone on Earth for free. You are making positive change on a scale that you cannot even fathom. Peace and kindness to you all.
6680,🥳🥳🥳💐💐💐
6681,in one video is awesome. I rather just stick to one tab. The original series is good but its broken up too much
6682,"Please, what&#39;s your advice guys, I am new to tech entirely. I hope starting here won&#39;t be bad for me as a newbie."
6683,This is so cool and educational! You compiled the CS50 Computer Science ❤
6684,"This is a great course, thanks!"
6685,Thanks for posting it here. It is so much easier to consume the content through youtube than their website. Appreciate it.
6686,Incredible. Thanks!
6687,Kindly do this with the python course- CS50P
6688,Thank you so much!
6689,Legendary!!
6690,I’m in a 9 grade of school rn and my teacher already told us about the lecture 0. So it was easy to understand everything.
6691,This is f**ing no wayyyyyyyyy! Sir thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6692,oh my god
6693,Thanks so much i was waiting for this video a long time
6694,@BurnLikeAFlame Mask doesn&#39;t hurt me. would you wear mask on stage? why?
6695,Point to us on this doll where the mask hurt you.
6696,Mask!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6697,This is insane. There goes a few of my weekends :) Thank you !
6698,If Dead pool was a professor😂😂🤗. ! This is phenomenal!
6699,"Not as dumb as... well, any comment you make. Point out on this doll where the mask hurt your feels."
6700,Mein Gott... Lecture in mask?? Quite klever men doing quite stupid things. Forever on youtube.
6701,This is job based course
6702,I’m here just to leave comment about how great this channel is !!! Truly amazing content
6703,¿Alguien más no le funciona bien los subtítulos?. 😔
6704,woooow⚡❤️
6705,Adds Hardvard University to CV 😁
6706,"2021, per the actual description text below the video."
6707,This course is of which year?
6708,This channel has waaay more content than I get studying at my university
6709,this channel will turn to Online University.
6710,Wow... thank you!
6711,FreeCodeCamp never fails to surprise me. I was thinking to take this but delaying for no reason. Now its officially here. I&#39;m gonna watch this for sure.
6712,"Hello, should we learn scratch? <br>I dont want to learn it"
6713,"How can we have this for free, this must be illegal 🥲, thanks freecodecamp"
6714,I appreciate u.
6715,"@BurnLikeAFlame If a video is just conceptual and I&#39;m only pausing for breaks and to explore side topics briefly, it takes about 15% longer than run time. If it&#39;s quite application problem/exercise dense that can get up to 120% over run time. I don&#39;t know what this will be but I&#39;m sure it will be beneficial."
6716,"And you may ask yourself, why is a 24 hour video taking you 50 hours..."
6717,This will be the best 50 hours of my life. Saving for later
6718,Thank YOU! I love that it is in one video!
6719,How is any video on this channel actually free. Big life safer!
6720,I’ve been going through this course but it so much more convenient to have it in one video!
6721,"Look I’m the same way, for me, learning was an actual habit I had to build. Once u build that habit you will learn"
6722,"I wish I could truly understand and retain the information all these people present. I really tried this course but it seems like I’m just hardwired for instant gratification. This industry isn’t for people like me, Who struggle to focus and have self discipline themselves. Maybe I don’t deserve to learn. I just hope you all achieve what you are trying to achieve."
6723,I completed a version of this a couple of years ago. Awesome course. I&#39;d never programmed before in my life and then started working through the algorithms and data structures in c book! This is where my obsession started!
6724,Dr. David Malan rarely refers to himself as &quot;Dr.&quot; and usually goes by David. He is a humble and relatable person. He is an excellent teacher that knows his stuff.
6725,thanks alot
6726,شكرا جدااااا
6727,Dear god. You’re awesome. Thank you.
6728,Where is my bachelor???
6729,David malan 💙 True motivation. Excellent Teacher.
6730,Mr.Malan is GREAT and INSPIRING person/teacher❤❤
6731,"Please take that mask off, it looks like he&#39;s gonna pass out."
6732,A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
6733,"Though posting a video containing a whole course is the best way to promote for that course, it&#39;s not a really great experience when the course gets like, 24h is waay long, so adding a link in the description of a playlist containing different parts of the course in separate videos would be just way better, that applies for all of the other courses that are long, like 4 hours long or more, thanks for the great content"
6734,thank god  2x speed  is a thing
6735,Wow ... One of the best?  Speaks volume about the decadent state of cs education...
6736,Thank u so much ❤😊
6737,@BurnLikeAFlame where can i find someone who can translate it?
6738,"No channel is obligated to translate everything into every single language on the planet. Especially one providing free videos. You want arabic, PAY someone to translate it."
6739,"Please translate it to arabic🙏🙏<br>This course is avaliable anywhere (edx ,youtube ,etc...) so if you wanna be spacial translate it to languages that the main course is not support it like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arabic"">#arabic</a> ♥️♥️🙏"
6740,thanks freecodecamp university!
6741,People are charging $10000+ for this program it&#39;s here for free
6742,Yes
6743,Can a complete beginner take this course with zero background of programming or tech? How much time does it take to complete the whole course? And would it be helpful in landing an entry level job? Thanks

6748,What
6749,"I&#39;m surprised how easy he makes it for everything to click, even though I have some experience with this already"
6750,This video just teaches everything an Indian University teaches in 4 years
6751,Wooooow. That&#39;s so cool 🥰
6752,Thanks FCC. I’ve watched this course three times now. Hello David!!!
6753,"Out of curiosity, since we get all these courses provided for FREE, did anyone really land jobs or were able to truly benefit from this learning platform? Or was it just used to understand fundamentals and go from there?"
6754,It&#39;s pretty stupid cuz there&#39;s no one on stage except for him. Looks like he just wanted to make a statement.
6755,with the  mask on the face he did not infect anyone. I don&#39;t understand ...
6756,It&#39;s much more convenient to have it as one video.
6757,the cybersecurity lecture has an issue with audio for headphone users
6758,I&#39;m simply watching straight from the Harvard channel as I know for sure it&#39;s 2022
6759,"@BurnLikeAFlame Rather ask in a comment than have to watch the video, read the description etc. and get lucky to find it"
6760,"I&#39;m betting if you actually read the description text in the video, it&#39;ll tell you. Cuz it does."
6761,Is this from 2022 or 2021?
6762,great freeCodeCamp!!! 👏👏👏
6763,Speechless 👏
6764,It took me 3 hours to notice that the audiance is made of muppets
6765,I rewatch some of CS50 videos when I need some motivation and a refresher.
6766,Better than every single of my university trachers
6767,"He is the professor who is more dedicated, more enthusiastic than the students in this course. He surely enjoys teaching and that&#39;s apparent on his face. Such energy is hardly seen..."
6768,&quot;Syllabus&quot; lol

6816,wat
6817,You can go into most big-room lectures. You just don&#39;t get college credit for it.
6818,"Super basic stuff, but a great introduction for those unfamiliar and really cool it&#39;s free. But it&#39;s free because this level of knowledge was already freely available basically anywhere so it doesn&#39;t really have the same inherent value as a more advanced course from a school like harvard."
6819,@Qi Jia 💀💀
6820,"The nice thing is that knowledge is free. But if you want a degree, you have to pay for it on top of learning the same things. I&#39;m personally against college/university. We don&#39;t need capitalism in education. Thankfully jobs tend to prefer experience over a piece of paper (except jobs that require specialized education, such as the medical field). I&#39;m in no way attacking classes, just the school/education system of this country.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll conclude my irrelevant rant there. Happy learning!"
6821,Huge respect to this channel and thanks for Harvard for letting us view this for FREE!

6831,@slim shady If you can&#39;t learn to program with the seemingly endless number of online resources you probably shouldn&#39;t have a job. We have social security for people like that.
6832,Bro many rich people don&#39;t get admission in Harvard. IT&#39;s not about how rich you are. The only thing matter is who hard working you are. Every successfull story have a backup of failure. So bro work Hard. Love from Yazi...

6842,It&#39;s really great course
6843,Amazing — thank you for creating this
6844,Amazing
6845,Thank you for this<br><br><br>Please add python programming by Harvard too please 🙏🙏🙏🙏...
6846,Como estas German tenes el link de la version 2015? si me lo podes dar?
6847,"He hecho varias versiones de ese curso. Así sea que se repitan los temas, pero es un placer ver estos cursos. Es más, la versión del 2015 me gusta mucho ya que aprendí PHP gracias a ella."
6848,This video was a good idea!
6849,"Oh my freaking, god. Thanks for making this possible and also thanks to Harvard for allowing you to share this content free forever.<br><br>The one on their official website is bound to get archived on later dates, so having one that is free forever is gonna help a lot of people."
6850,"Thank you so much, FreeCodeCamp ❤! What an amazing idea to put a full course in one place 👍"
6851,my main question is: why is he wearing a face mask while there is nobody around on the stage?
6852,"What a time to be living in, this education which was once inconceivable to the average person, is now freely available without charge. No one promised us a utopia, for that we must use these educational resources to build the world of our dreams."
6853,Why did he use the mask lol
6854,@vonHübl Thank you!
6855,@Jsusbdndk @Jsusbdndk I&#39;m not sure if my time frame would line up with yours. I was doing about 1 lecture and subsequent homework for a week - 2 weeks when I had time. The homework takes a while but is very rewarding. I was not able to watch a full lecture every day just fit it I to my limited time frame! The homework takes longer the deeper into the course you get. I was working full time about 60 hours per week and putting in a little time onto this! I started about late Feb 2022. I do believe the way the material is oriented that if you gave yourself a structured schedule and stuck with it you could absolutely achieve your goal!
6856,"@Jocelyn Vazquez yes very beginner friendly, no experience needed just a desire to learn!"
6857,"Hey, I&#39;m going to start this course in december hopefully afte i&#39;m done with cs50python. i just wanted to ask how much time did it take you to finish the course? I want to get done about half of it by the end of january 2023."
6858,"Honestly seeing how his energy is always 100% - I, as a future teacher, am quite intimidated by that. Guess I really need to drink a can of coffee to be that high energy but I will try to atleast get close."
6859,I&#39;m currently in my final project for this course and I&#39;d just like to say that David Malan is one of the best teacher&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had! Definitely worth sticking through to the end. Definitely worth completing the homework assignments.
6860,"I&#39;m pro mask, but I feel for the instructor here.  He&#39;s under hot lights, wearing a mask, and obviously hot as hell.  Feel like since he&#39;s far enough away from his students he should be able to get away with not wearing a mask for comfort."
6861,"Wow, as CS student i shocked to see this new upload..."
6862,I am so glad he wears a mask! 😂
6863,Thanks a Lot ♥
6864,"Thanks, nice to review basics :)"
6865,"and this is free? This is like socialism, but real"
6866,"I watched every second of the video, I can say that the subject is about computer science."
6867,"my man, harvard&#39;s cs50 is the best course available online for free, which will definitely build the basic structure into your programming world! cheers for making this into a single video!!!!!"
6868,I JUST started watching the lectures yesterday lol thanks for combining them all together!
6869,7mins in &amp; my guy is already sweating bullets
6870,Wiw🔥
6871,Thank you 🙏
6872,This is the best course ever 😎
6873,Hatsoff and Hands down for you guys. You are truly amazing. You are true philanthropist for the Tech world. Keep it up. ♥️👏
6874,"freecodecamp has helped me so much in my learning phase with so much of free resources. I have never thanked you all this time, thank you freecodecamp, you are amazing 🙏🙌"
6875,GOOD JOB!
6876,Hi is Legend
6877,69gb for 2160p version. the AVC1 1080p version is only 9gb.  (-f 137)
6878,"@Adi purnomo im sorry, thanks for fix my error 👉👍🤚🥇"

6880,"Wooow, i start learning and first listen about this channel in start my way in dev, good practice, Dave Malone 👍🔥⭐"
6881,oh yeah! merci guys!!
6882,"This is amazing! thanks for sharing it! 🔥<br><br>Excellent starting point for anyone who is starting as a software developer"
6883,this is so stupid they&#39;re like 20 feet away at least lol
6884,I don&#39;t understand how such &quot;smart&quot; people at Harvard require an instructor to wear a mask for virtue signaling. Is anyone within 6 feet of him during his entire lecture?
6885,Wish they combined a year without face diapers.
6886,İncredible best video!
6887,This needed to happen 100 years ago. Thank you!
6888,"Amazing video, you dont need to go to university, you can learn it on youtube"
6889,Wow 🥺 FULL UNIVERSITY COURSE in A Single Video Awesome 😊😎🙏❤️ So GRATEFUL 😇
6890,ikr so cringe
6891,Omg the guy wearing a mask alone on the stage. That scam really touched even the most prestigious places ...
6892,Many thanks for your effort! I absolutely buy your t-shirt!
6893,It’s wild to me that this is free
6894,"This page channel is precious, one of the best if not the best in Youtube for coding. Thank You"

6902,Always needed this one
6903,Thank you sir
6904,This is one of the best beginner computer science courses out there. The target audience is anybody interested in computer science or programming.
6905,who is the target audience of that course..... or what are the main learnings one may take away? if anyone explain thta
6906,David Malan the 🐐 professor
6907,We are so lucky 🥺 <br>Thank you FreeCodeCamp!
6908,Can I start this with minimal knowledge?
6909,is this a dream... man it&#39;s just .... WOW!!!!!!!
6910,देखते हैं 🇮🇳🇮🇳 इस तिरंगे को कितने लाइक मिलते हैं
6911,Loads and loads of love for you freecodecamp ❤️❤️❤️

6923,"Thanks so much freecodecamp you&#39;re the best, without this channel, I really don&#39;t know what could have become of me in tech. Thousands dollars course is what you guys offer for free. Thanks so much most especially to my world best mentor/tutor Mr. Dave Gray 💜❤️much love sir 🙏"
6924,I used to work at a call center and would cry every day. Hated it. This course was the first course I took after years of dabbling in code. That was 3 years ago. I&#39;m a python programmer now.
6925,Let&#39;s Go! This is what dreams are made of!
6926,David Malan and Brian Yu have become my favourite prorgramming teachers
6927,It&#39;s just amazing. Thanks a lot.
6928,Thank you so much for everything you guys do!

6945,"For some reason when he first brought up his paper at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710&amp;t=3m45s"">3:45</a> I thought it said &quot;-2 Get the hell out&quot; for a split second."
6946,I just started CS50 the day before yesterday lol.
6947,@Dan Trebune right! It was just my guess
6948,@Kj sure
6949,Is CS-50 really good?
6950,"@Natsu Y probably since 2021, this cs50 lectures is from 2021"
6951,How long did it take you to get to that point?
6952,"Dayum isn&#39;t this CS50 Intro to Computer Science? Week 3-5 was really tough for me, but its all worth it. Who would have thought I would start from 0 to building full stack flask apps. Thank you CS50."
6953,It is the best!!!!
6954,"No you don&#39;t, it gets annoying."
6955,Harvard I want my Degree now.
6956,This is the best youtube channel for tech students on the internet......love u guyzz....tonnes of respect ❤love from india 🇮🇳
6957,THANKS A LOT ❤️
6958,Is this the 2021 one?
6959,This channel is Manna from above
6960,future programers hero &quot;freeCordCamp&quot;
6961,As this php..!!
6962,"Thank you for this course, very helpful."
6963,A one day long video. Not something you see every day.
6964,You can&#39;t see it continuously. <br>Atleast watch it for 10 days just for fun and for understanding it will take a months if you don&#39;t know any concept...
6965,Is this everything or do I have to go on website i thought it was a 100 hours
6966,"Yes, myself as well. Cheers, and good studies!"
6967,this is where I&#39;ve started.<br>Such an awesome course.<br>I am planning to run through the entire session once just for fun 🙂
6968,This here is sooooo Epic!!!!!!
6969,this is the best course I had completed older versions of this course last week and that was the greatest 💯💯💯💯
6970,Thank you soooo much 🎉🎉
6971,"Every time I watch this channels videos, I always say &#39;what could be better than this&#39; &amp; everytime they nails it.... 🔥🔥🔥"
6972,Harvard and all of these other colleges &quot;businesses&quot; should be paying everyone&#39;s bills for the rest of their life is they went to college and had to pay for this crap. Though it&#39;s a nice gesture it&#39;s completely against capitalism that the United States runs on and unfair to anyone who had to pay for any of this crap just for it to be given to the whole world for free.
6973,Freecodecamp keeps giving!
6974,"CS50 is the best, and actually does it the way I wish this channel did: Teach you how to do a variety of things, instead of just showing you how to do specific things. A lot of tutorials of FreeCodeCamp are only helpful if you&#39;re wanting to make the exact thing the tutorial is about"
6975,Woowwwwwwwww 🎉
6976,<b>THIS IS GREAT</b><br><br><br><br>Watching this video at 3min of uploading ☺️
6977,Love CS50 - This is where I started
6978,@Daayem Shehzad 😂
6979,@Jatin Gera you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ve never seen this anywhere else. I did finish it within 4-5 mins. It doesn&#39;t take that long if you&#39;re dedicated to learning.
6980,"Seems like people in reply section don&#39;&#39;t know that these videos were already there , so his comment is legit"
6981,"@nebojsa knezevic this video was posted on edx before to be posted pon freecodecamp , maybe he watched the video there."
6982,"If you could just go ahead and learn &#39;so&#39; much instead of &#39;soo&#39; much, that would be great... OK?!"
6983,Ahhh I just learned soo much from this entire video!! Thank you for uploading it.
6984,From somali 🇸🇴
6985,I happy to hear and watching my favorite courses in one day. <br>Give you one big hug for all team working this video 💞💞💓❣️
6986,He is one of the best ❤️
6987,Thank you a lot for this man ♥️♥️♥️
6988,Wow is this free  . Damn !! Thanks
6989,Need fullstack dev❤
6990,It has sound but the final section may not be stereo.
6991,Guys what about the last part it has no sound
6992,Harvard is at your home... WOW 😲
6993,W youtube channel
6994,Holy...!
6995,I was searching it now only and you posted
6996,You did it 👏🏾
6997,FreeCodeCamp suoremacyyyy!!!
6998,Thus my friends is the Bible of the courses if you aim to learn from the basics.
6999,Please help put a time stamp on the video please!
7000,yeah lmao its always been divided let them have this unification for once
7001,"@Aadhil Moola maybe its too much for you if it gets overwhelming? Just take a break dude, its not that serious lol"
7002,@Ronald Harris I&#39;m taking this course currently on edX and all this in one would have completely overwhelmed me. It&#39;s split up for a reason to allow you time to soak up the info and most importantly complete the Psets and Labs.<br><br>Also what about the shorts? I&#39;ve learnt so much from Polo Shirt Doug.<br><br><br>In any case all these videos are already uploaded on the cs50 Youtube in a playlist.<br><br>This is good for awareness tho I guess
7003,@Fysics Iz Phun if you’ve taken the course on coursera you’d know how annoying it is to go through every slide. This way its all in one place in a continuous video. Easily accessible now
7004,So amazing to combine cs50 course in one video thanks ❤
7005,It is creative commons and we got permission from David J Malan to post the course.
7006,Isn&#39;t it copyright content?
7007,Amazing Content Thanks FreeCodeCamp Team
7008,its actually free on edx and i think coursera as well. Many university courses are free on these platforms.
7009,How did you calculate 10 000? lmao
7010,Note: This is the 2021 version. They do those presentations like every year or every two years. Right now they&#39;re half-way through recording the 2022 version.
7011,Thats already free lol
7012,CS50 was always free bruv
7013,10 thousand dollar computer science course is now free..<br><br>Salute to free code camp 💯💐
7014,First to watch this fantastic course 😂
7015,"this channel is not a CS channel, and the course is a course for non-CS people who have to take a technical elective"
7016,Best CS course on best CS channel what a duo😮
7017,There are actually many free courses at Harvard and other unis
7018,@heavymetalmixer I think it&#39;s because they know that if the world is gonna continue progressing with tech etc then it&#39;s gonna need a lot more ppl that can do this stuff. Idk though I&#39;m trying to figure out where to start to become a data analyst from square -2 since I barely know basic math and can&#39;t type. I should find a mentor.
7019,education is free.
7020,Al the CS50 fmaily of courses (&#39;cause there are other CS50 courses) are free. I guess Harvard really thinks the future for everyone is programming.
7021,@Zeno ya that&#39;s right ☺️
7022,The fact you gave this for free is mind boggling
7023,I really like you guys. Excellent merge. Thanks
7024,"Huuuge,  thank you so much for yoyr efforts"
7025,Thanks to harvard and freecodecamp
7026,Education should be free for all.
7027,... but face mask and sweat like hell 🤦‍♂
7028,@Pi education is ALWAYS valuable… it is  one thing you can add to that adds back double each time.
7029,@Drue I plan on getting a CERT soon.
7030,@Pi enroll in community college and test out…
7031,"Not all heroes wear cape. It sometimes baffles me to know, that this content is free on the internet 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"

7890,I understand 👍
7891,I read the interview in a blog
7892,coding is to blogging* what programming is to writing
7893,CS took a big step backwards by relying on numbers. The human brain doesn&#39;t use numbers nor does anything in nature appear to use numbers. What nature does use is pure non numerical geometry.

7898,"We always knew this, at least where I&#39;ve worked since 1982.  It is well known that &quot;domain knowledge&quot; or, in other words, a fuller understanding of the goal of doing the programming, it&#39;s reason for existence, is very very important.  I&#39;ve approached it from a domain expert first, constructing algorithms that worked, and then treating the programming of it as a general task which needed to be bug free of course."
7899,Kind of abstract but at the same time pleasant.
7900,Merci pour la vidéo et le témoignage.
7901,Have heard a lot about this same woman couple of times my only regret is not starting up on this on time am glad I could find a way to reach out to her from this conversation☺️.
7902,A lot of investors have restrained from the market because of the volatile and sudden crash in the market. But I&#39;ve learned to understand that trading is quite different from just holding. There are short sales for bearish and long sales for bullish.
7903,Take it from one who has bought a house in Missouri and his dream car with forex trade profits.

Or you could take two days to write a description in the language he invented -- and THEN go ahead and spend the two hours writing the program... Academics give me a pain in the gizzard. They actually believe that they are adding value by making things more complicated."

7914,i have no what idea what you&#39;re talking about but congrats and great work bro
7915,What a brilliant mind and yet so humble. The way math is taught at school is so flawed. Imagine having this guy as your teacher in early school.
7916,"I wish more people knew Computer Science was born directly from Mathematics. This man is a legend, that&#39;s for sure. But, he knows what other&#39;s legends know. Computer Science&#39;s father was a Mathematician."

7939,This should be the first video you watch before Starting a module on these concepts
7940,Being a computer science student by background I cannot understand a few of the things he talks about I mean the amount of knowledge he has about computers is just awesome this gen needs to learn from an individual like him
7941,I’d read anything this guy wrote.
7942,Amazing! So lucky to have heard him!
7943,His theory of distribution is also used in cloud computing where data is stored in more than one dara center

7945,"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)<br>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)<br>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)"
7946,Computers are ruining man´s ability to think.  As for AI  -  well how do you like those computer security tests that tell you that youare not you???
7947,That&#39;s a so informative video
7948,i don&#39;t get it but i enjoyed it
7949,sir do you teach?
7950,The title is so funny.
7951,He just triggered so many ideas in my head.
7952,"i don&#39;t wanna take away from his accomplishments, but how about the man who invented CS with math- Alan Turing.Just disagree with the caption."

7954,He looks like Noam Chomsky&#39;s twin brother!
7955,"&quot;We tend to think in programming languages&quot;, meanwhile they are showing HTML (&#39;:"
7956,"&quot;If people are trying to learn programming by being taught how to code, well, they are being taught writing by being taught how to type and that does not make much sense. The best way  to teach programming is to think about programming mathematically. &quot;<br><br>This is the truth of it. Too many programmers nowadays complain about being asked an algorithm question at an interview. Looking at how you solve an algorithmic/combinatorial/mathematical question tells me a lot more about you how you think even if you just brute force memorized bunch of solutions.<br>On the other hand, if the question is only about a specific issue like how to debug something happened at work, then I would only know how knowledgeable you are on that issue. <br><br>It&#39;s funny how people who complain about coding interview questions think the former is about brute force memorization and the latter is about problem-solving, when it&#39;s actually the exact opposite."
7957,like the guy who added letters to math
7958,Coding is to programming what typing is to writing.
7959,This man answered my decades long hunt of why people use terms like coding in place of programming.<br><br>Thank you Master
7960,And I hate that man for doing that
7961,Are people born this way or do they become obsessed with an idea and never let go? Or is it passion? Asking for a friend

7968,"But programming is time consuming, I don&#39;t like the approach of how can I do it better. If it works move on. The main goal is to get the program done, not create a brilliant algorithm"

8009,it looks more like a chat session then ar a video comment.
8010,"sorry rectification. i said it wrong<br><br>the sequence MAY BE..<br><br>... -3, -2, -1, -0, 0 1 2 3 4... to infinite.<br>so minus zero is the biggest negative number. so to say  infinite large. but stated as minus zero. and between negative minus zero. and positive zero (as on a graph with x and y axis) i dont know what is between them. ? to make a fliud transistion between a negative number collection and the positive number colection.. i know between -1 and zero is 1, the distance is 1, the value 1, and the distance between -1 and (plus 1) is two, two equal units. and the largest positive number is infinite, while the largest or biggest or the unit with the greatest value of the collection negative numbers is -0 or minus zero. if negative zero and positive zero is the same ? we never debatted that. we used two zero&#39;s on the second degree graph. but. they where in the same spot.! on the x axia and on the y axis. just the center. main point here. is they could be the same. yet i call them differently, so no number has an excpetional rule. and they all fit the same unit identification. as in basic numberology. and principles of mathamatics and algebra and counting. all unique studies. and the foundation of math. and therefor also for most computer software and.. hardware. but between -0 and 0 is not infinite. maybe infinite small?? debat is open. and at both ends infinite large. sory forbthat mistake. i could not find my message or comment back underneath this video between all the fanatic contributers."
8011,"Inspiring, very! 🤩"
8012,"Sauch is a humble guy, He says he &quot;stumbled on it&quot; that just shows how sweet of a person he is."
8013,we call a million. 1000000 or 1 000 000 infinite. so called nerver ending. an unpracticle number for a human. so infinite.
8014,one one third times three is four. so one one zero times zero is one. there is no wrong eqeation. math is rule based. no wrong rules. so no wrong answers.
8015,therefor. you can see a number as a individual numer. or as a unique number. or as a relative number in relation wich his value towards another number. or as a symbolic reference towards a physicle object around you.
8016,dont forget that evrybody needs to be loved and therefor everybody needs equal attention. nobody is special. everybody is special. it is not a selfish race. it is all together as  team.
8017,a work around is adding in the code plus 1000 and substract 1000 for display on screen wich gives still the correct anwer.
8018,"how many times 3 is 4 ? whell one, one thirs. one time itself gives 3 and one third itself times 3 gives 4. thus.<br>1,1/3×3=4<br>this can be written as<br>a,1/a=a+1<br>there are different ways to note.<br>a × ( 1 + (  1 ÷ a)) = a + 1<br>therefor<br>msince the comouter has no minus zero<br>it goes from minus 1 towards zero towards 1<br>so<br>something like this in a basic program exposes a computer error when calculating with zero:code follows maybe need a minor correction: a and b are variables and therefor interchangeable with numbers. those letters can store a number value. instead of haveing a fixed value themself.<br><br>for a = -3 to 3<br>b = a *  ( 1 + ( 1 / a))<br>print b<br>next a<br><br>wich deliver on any computer i know. likenthis<br><br>-3<br>-2<br>-1<br>0<br>error<br>2<br>3<br><br>or similair.<br>task was. print on screen in code. the numbers sequence from minus 3 towards positive 3 with a formule upon the next number is a fraction of itself. to see if it can calculate with zero.<br><br>good luck."
8019,"there is a design question though. about the transition between negative number collection and a positive number collection. first the highest negative number is minus 0. it is the number wich is the least negative and therefor has the highest value, after the highest value, wich can be debated, comes infinite. so<br><br>-3 -2 -1 -0 infinite.<br>if that is a fact<br>then<br>positive numbers<br>nothing 0 1 2 3 4 et ce tera till infinite or other practical cum laude or succesfull limits<br>then as every number is a number also zero can be calculated with. no formula can be wrong. thus. as wrong as we are teached. we can offcourse calculate with zero. but not with this hardware. except that a number is a thing on it its own. it also has a relative position in sequence on a graph or in value towards a neightbour number wich can be always be displaced as a fraction of itself.<br><br>also for 0<br>the difference between 3 and 4 its neigbour number is 4-3=1 thus if we want to count from 3 to 4 we newd to overlapp the distance with a 1 value. since 3 has 3 1 values and 4 has 4 one values. therefor we can say. one third extra upon 3 as an add on gives as 4. therefor we can distille the number 4 out of 3 in an equation."
8020,as long is the answer is correct. so.<br>human calculation &gt; hidden practical translation&gt; internal computer calculation &gt; translation &gt; correct verifiyable human answer.
8021,computers should use relative numbers and not hardware ones. another human number should have a easy to proccess computer hardware representativ. like a human read for example the number 5. that number is displayed. it could mean internally for easy computer calculating the number 2000.

8023,"Recently I studied about mutual exclusion in Operating Systems and learned how to solve it. Solutions were pretty much problematic because either way, they do not serve the whole purpose. Mutual exclusion is all about how the critical section of two or more tasks will execute parallelly. There was a some premeditated thoughts like this must be initialized like this or that. But the point he made about assumption is something like a straight forward solution that has a time complexity O(1). If you have nothing to assume, then your solution works faster and more efficiently than you can imagine. With assumptions, things get difficult to manage. And the distributed systems are the future. Centralized systems are a threat now a days. It actually makes the whole system vulnerable. Once it is distributed, it will be easier to keep up the flow of everything in a system without any hassle though it is very complicated to implement right now."
8024,This man is just insane🔥🔥
8025,"There are people, like the ones behind the programming language smalltalk, that say all programming environments are message passing systems. If one considers programming languages like java with keywords such as : &quot;public/private&quot; and &quot;static&quot; outside of function scope, even before getting into expected return types, then one realizes how baseline signals and discrete dileneations of wave functions along circuitry come into play, aka &quot;fuzzying&quot;. There is a point where the rubber meets the road so to speak in live systems and Lamport&#39;s work becomes more of a conceptual framework for liveness and correctness in distrubted systems design, allbeit an extemely useful framework which I used to refine the message passing in the econometric sphere of information. He was a great influence and I am grateful that his thinking came before mine, as I am grateful for all great men of history, including the golang team at google.

8068,i enjoyed reading Quanta magazine&#39;s article
8069,He’s totally right. The way that math is taught is terrible. Mostly because they don’t teach us how to do anything with it and do t use enough application lessons.
8070,"I&#39;m so happy to know about this guy - and what a guy. But at the same time, it sadddens me: I have a real wish to go back to my childhood and start all over again - but do it right this time."

8072,"1.  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>2.  And the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.<br>3.  Then God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot;; and there was light."
8073,"The gospel I would say is the main message of the Bible, it is the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and what He did on the cross for all of humanity.   <br> <br> But, before talking about Jesus and the cross, we need to look at the problem of humanity, the problem every one of us is faced with. Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven. Romans 3:23 says: &quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot;. Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though, yes, sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times. We commit moral crimes, and we rebel against God, which the Bible calls sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, and we can lust and have hate for our brother in our hearts. These are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime, sin has to be punished. If God did not punish sin, then He would be unjust. He would be corrupt. Someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: &quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;. This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death; if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls. Near-death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body.  <br>     God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world. He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to and being in our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;. Three days after Jesus was crucified, He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real-world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not just a nice story.<br>        Scripture tells us to repent, to put our trust in Jesus, and to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned. No one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible. This is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves; it is the gift of God for one to be saved. God is rich in mercy and ready to forgive, cry out to Him, be sincere when coming to God, this is not a flippant thing. Repent and place your trust in Jesus Christ alone, today is the day of salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot;. Salvation is a gift. <br><br>      There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: &quot;That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;&quot;"
8074,A brilliant mind no doubt. I would take exception the the remark equating coding to typing. What a disparaging comment! Someone has to take the algorithm and implement the logic to make it useful.

Some day, there will be programming languages which can tolerate minor typographic errors, such as using a space character as a delimiter instead of a comma.

8118,What are you talking about! We see that many successful people who lead the big tech companies nowadays were never mathematicians but still they were able to create something that almost everyone is in need of. High level of math such as Calculus is never needed to be a programmer.

8126,"After spending some time with true maths, not the awful thing teached at school, but the true maths where numbers are linked to reality, it becomes natural to simplify complex things by breaking them into smaller parts. And this is the real meaning of Algorithm as invented by Musa Mehmetoğlu at the time of the Harezm nation, nowadays Azerbaycan...  Mathematic is the science of explaining the reality with numbers. Computing or programming computers is the art of automating mathematics. Writing programs is still an art not a science, that is why there are a lot of bugs, programming errors. With OOP, bankers decided to deviate from maths by forcing programmers to think like Western philosophers. Now simple things, like a web page is over complicated. Complex things like quantum became evden more complex. The reality is that quantum physics is really simple. There is no need at all to have 2 different law of physics to explain the reality at the subatomic scale or beyond the atom. Both laws are the same... One day I will explain this more clearly. Thank you for Latex, Mr Lamport, one of the last real scientist..."

8180,"While it’s clear that he made significant contributions to computers and networks, calling it “computer science” is a misnomer. Why? Because there is nothing natural about computers. They are man made machines. And in science, which is the pursuit to discover natural laws that explain the world we live in, there are fundamental laws of nature that describe our world and that are then used to make predictions about other things in nature which then lead to the discovery of more laws of nature. None of that exists in “computer science.” Also mathematics is no replacement for experimentation and observation. Sure math is useful for explaining things we observe in nature, but using math as “proof” of anything is like having a cart driving a horse. Also on the subject of Einstein and Relativity, this is a perfect case in point where high level mathematics has deceived multiple generations into believing a fallacy. Nikola Tesla disproved Relativity when he stated simply that a vacuum of space, which by definition is the absence of all matter, can not also behave like a medium. You can not warp or bend space, because again you can’t bend something that is by definition nothing at all. It’s a non sequitur. He also disproved Einsteins famous E-MC2 equation, when he showed that all energy came from the Aether, and that no energy whatsoever was transferred in matter. So Einstein is the perfect example of how using high level mathematics as “proof” of something can lead to generations believing in a lie."

8247,"I have two bachelors degrees. I first graduated college with a B.A. as a math major. I took one programming class while in that program and I realized that it&#39;s really similar to math. Simpler than math, if you ask me. I saw the correlation immediately. However, I didn&#39;t feel I knew enough about the coding side of things. To use the analogy in this video, I knew the math but I didn&#39;t know how to type! I felt like it was all right there at my fingertips though, I just had to learn the technical details. For four years after I got that math degree, I tried teaching myself how to code on sites like Udacity and Coursera, but I realized I was spinning my wheels. Doing the same Hello World over and over again in different languages. I needed to go back to school and have a planned out curriculum with resources and professors to guide me. So, after those four years I went back to college for 2 more years and got a second degree! This time a B.S. in computer science. <br><br>Well, wouldn&#39;t you know it. I breezed through it. Like, the math background absolutely set me up for success here. I was a consistent C level student my whole life, but this time I&#39;m was making president&#39;s and dean&#39;s lists and getting scholarships. I had found my niche! And if it wasn&#39;t for math I don&#39;t know if I would have ever figured it out. Had I gone the other way and just started with computer science, I&#39;m not sure I would have had as much success or knew why I was doing it. Math called to me in my younger years, and it was just so applicable to the theory of computer science that my intuition for it was already developed. I just needed just a little push that&#39;s all. <br><br>Personally, I see writing a program as like writing a math proof. You need to figure out which concepts go together and parameterize your problem. For me, writing pseudocode is where I can really draw on my math background. Without having to worry about syntax and missed semi colons, I can focus solely on the problem and really figure out what really needs to happen to implement something. When your pseudocode is rock solid, you barely even have to think when you&#39;re coding something up. Just go through your pseudocode line by line and figure out the syntax on stack overflow. If I didn&#39;t have that pseudo, then swapping between SO and my IDE would exhaust me so quickly. But with that pseudo, all the hard thinking is done. It&#39;s just a matter of typing it up at that point!<br><br>Thanks for this video. It resonated with me. My favorite part was this part toward the end: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=6m22s"">6:22</a>"
8248,"If &quot;the algorithm still works&quot; x 10 then why can&#39;t he explain it to us in a logical fashion? He does  not give us a full enough description to specify what he had invented and so we can understand what it does exactly and how it works. As a mathematically thinking guy, I find this annoying and I usually observe it in blondes. Now I observe irony."

Some people might think that this is conceited but I think I this would be a misunderstanding. I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to make original discoveries in my field and such innovations really feel like a gift. It&#39;s as though somebody or something has given the ideas to you. You do feel thankful. I suspect that this is what he is emotional about, that he was fortunate enough, after thousands and thousands of hours of hard work, to be gifted something original. It really is an amazing, emotion feeling."

8273,Can someone who actually understands explain what he said at the end about how the algorithm doesn&#39;t make assumptions about the numbers when some exchanges a number? He gave an example of 47 and changing it for 100 and then talked of other numbers.<br>He surely meant more than just about the range of available numbers.<br>What did he mean and why is it so important?
8274,"My favorite contribution from him is the Lamport one-time signature scheme. It&#39;s unusual to encounter a cryptographic algorithm which is both secure and easy to understand. In fact, Lamport OTS is believed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks including Shor&#39;s algorithm.<br><br>I came across Lamport OTS while I was trying to come up with my own hash-based signature scheme (mostly out of curiosity) and I was blown away by its simplicity and elegance. I could explain it to 10 year old."
8275,"I agree.  He is only six years older than I, and we started studying compter science within just a few years of each other.  I quickly learned that Computer Science was mathematical, and that programming does not make computer science.  I didn’t learn it from Lamport.<br><br>Computer Science as a discipline was created by mathematicians and electrical engineers.  Both are fundamentally important."
8276,"Leslie Lamport is a giant in the field of computer science, no question. But to call him the man who &quot;revolutionized computer science with math&quot; seems a bit silly, given the many highly mathematical developments in the history of the field."

8288,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗨𝗸𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱<br>The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.<br>The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.<br>The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.<br>Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.<br>We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.<br>We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.<br>The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.<br>Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.<br>Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.<br>Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us."

8300,"I think its more of hte problem relation of the lanague of mathematics in how its taught...<br><br>So as muc has when I go through my memories through private catholic or public system, I don&#39;t think any of these systems were very good to teach. Catholics had  great dicipline funciton but it was based on reptition and endless repetition far form creativity. Public was creative and messy and each year, it was building on what was learned last year, but nothing was really taught...<br><br>SO I had a standard in my head that I would of prefered. which is a library or journal book that we carry through the years, like a field book, it can be copied and codified.. Each Main academic subject can have it, This way the classes are not entirely separate but onyl separate to enhance the use of that subject, but they are all entwined technically. <br><br>The biggest opposition for me in math is the symbol use of language, peopel look at you like yoru dumb, but if i have no udnerstanding on what the symbol represetns then it is basically looking at nothing but gibberish, its not until the program decompiles and reveals itself to me in what others are relating ot what they already havei nputed inthem at some point. <br><br>Symbols are simple like + for adding. adding is taking a numeric value of a whole unit and adding it to the next whole unit. Then we input language and numeric representation, and we operate in base ten. We convey reality of adding and subtracting via, oranges and apples... real world example. Mutiplication and division, are also the same system of adding and subtracting, but these are shorthand symbols to represent a large expression of numbers that are all the same. Real world example would be 6 apples per crate and there are 8 crates. How many apples in total.  Real world use which is a relation of udnerstanding the symbol meaning.<br><br><br>Then we have the special E for SUM.... which i demanding a specific answer. Then we have x... which technically what should away be at the other side of the equal sign. Equal is litearlly balancing of systems between both sides. So math sentences that operate cancell each other.. the basis of math... which relates to physics well for a law of thermaldynaimics , lol...<br><br>So in that regard, each symbol needs a defintion and exmaple of its operational use, but then we leanr shortcuts or they are thrown at you and you have no basis so you lose trakc its like constnatly using words like clastic, or karst in class and no one has a relation to those words... its empty in meaning, until your like oh.. that what they mean... Most of the geology words like that the netire geology system itself in humanity oculd get an overhaul to keep things simpel and using prgamin softwareand more so its more planetary so off world movements become a relation of langauge nad htus ocnverted into other langauge sets eiaser ot ocnvey the knowledge better of what one is observing.<br><br><br>WHere am I stuck in math... I am stuck at differential equations and not being able to afford a tutor and teaching onself its rather diffcult task, just like in Chemstry I had a hard time with apparently the calcuating mols... but then in physics I did well... except for one part.... but the relation of units and games allowed one ot make ones own easy formulas. meaning... we have a lto fo englis hslang or jargon that shouldn&#39;t be taught, but has crept into public nad soicety as an education means which faisl to communicate the act..<br><br>We use like the word PER to me divide by x unit.. Miles PER hour means m/p this unit difference allows us to figure out what we want and how units relate...<br><br>If I stated I had six bagooo per 3 troxins per 50 lixels. I am saying 6/3/50 we have three divisional pattern and thus we do the order of operations... what would that equal.. and what units woudl be getting rid of... once we divide the  we would be getting a fraction of nubmer but all the worlds would be conencted. if I had 300bagoolixels, how many troxins is that? so unit canceling nad movement allows you to figure thigns out if you know yoru desired relation at the end... so playing games of use names allows one to udenrstand hte movement of wha words mean...<br><br>then ther eare confusing things of like, how cna time unit be squared, liek seconds squared.. etc... can create confusion to its relation in teh real world....<br><br> so math is a basis that teaches like a roman method of slap them i nthe face utni lthey get it, but doesn&#39;t teach udnerstanding the terms nad principles as a langauge... which would be way better, and most humans would accelerate. So the nonsense of asians this and america this, much of it is a relation of the human stance nad quality of a place.. not so much a identity of nation... we have problems asa species.. which is a thing... from gender wars, to identity wars... whislt most are simpyl trying ot relate and oeprate in giving somethign to better society.. whilst otehrs devour it.. lol for themselves."

8329,"He didn&#39;t reduced &quot;coding&quot; to &quot;typing&quot;, he&#39;s just made a comparison... but even if &quot;coding&quot; is so complex, as you say, it is still a type of typing--into a computer!"
8330,"Everybody talking about how humble this guy is, and I can&#39;t help but be aghast at how he reduced coding to &quot;typing&quot;, simply because he&#39;s an &quot;expert&quot;. Coding is much more than that, it&#39;s about an entire language, one that a computer understands."
8331,An outstanding person.
8332,Physics without mathmatics is NOTHING!
8333,Math is very important in other fields such as Physics and almost all Engineering.
8334,"I knew Greta Tunberg, i wouldn&#39;t have known about this man if it weren&#39;t for a random youtube reccomnedation.... 😔<br>What have be become?"
8335,"@GH1618 I agree there&#39;s lots of math and varied histories. That said, you fundamentally misunderstand the relationship between engineering and science. Engineering is not a part of science. Science is a part of engineering. I&#39;ll tell you what I told my statistics students when I taught. Science is about doing experiments to find truth and determine the nature of reality. Engineers take it several steps further. We want to know about truth and reality not just for its own sake but to know the future and, in knowing the future, control or manipulate it for our clients&#39; gain, our gain, and hopefully society&#39;s gain. To put it another way, engineering is science applied, at scale, efficiently and economically.<br><br>Most of the CS folks I&#39;ve worked with were a little too abstract. The ones I have the most respect for called themselves &quot;computational physicists&quot;. Right up there with them, are the folks who did electronics engineering in addition to their computer science."
8336,"Computer Science is a blend of mathematics and engineering.  The first departments of Cumputer Science were founded by either mathematicians or electrical engineers, which is why some CS departmements were in the college of arts and sciences and others in the college of engineering.  Both of my CS degrees are from engineering colleges, but there is plenty of math content regardless."
8337,"That&#39;s nice but he didn&#39;t need to crap all over engineers. I like math just fine and that&#39;s good he recognized the value of tackling real problems. The analogy differentiating coding from programming is nice too and I&#39;d argue that engineering is yet a third beast. Finally, the algorithm/math focus is funny and not surprising. Personally, given my experience, I&#39;d argue it is the data structures and how they fit the nature of the problem that are critical. Certain structures facilitate certain algorithms better than others."
8338,"Oh, please."
8339,This guy is the Saint of Computer Science
8340,"I do not know what this Sir is talking about, but I agree with him!"
8341,@Dominik Baričák Saying that because ‘a’ was necessary to build ‘b’ doesn’t lead to ‘a’ being necessary to use ‘b’. The skills and knowledge used to build a car are not required to drive one and so on. Logic and math may intersect at times but the two can stand alone. And the former is more so a crux of everyday programming than any higher mathematics
8342,"without math you couldn&#39;t even do the work you do, because the machines you use couldn&#39;t exist without math and physics."
8343,"I am a programmer and IT administrator / devops and I never really needed mathematics. All I needed was LOGIC, my dude. So no, I would not agree that you need math to work in IT. And no, I do NOT do simple CODING, based on templates of any sort.<br><br>I do understand that some people think that math is at the core of everything but I - as a philosophy major - can only tell you that this is not correct. If you know logic, you can do it all. Logic is at the core. You can argue that math is logic, but you can - as successfully - argue that math is actually logic ... so yeah. Bite it!"
8344,"The idea of formal specifications for programs certainly predates Lamport&#39;s work. I have been doing programming and design of systems from the early1970s. Even in the 1980s there were formal systems used to specify and verify systems. It seems that every generation or so we reinvent what came before and call it something new. This has been borne out by friends of mine who collected rare books. They noted this and found it to be true. I am just starting to educate myself on TLA+. It seems to be a good approach, but it is certainly not the first, Lamport, just by looking at him, seems to be my age. i certainly don&#39;t think that he is the one to do the things you attribute to him."
8345,CS is directly propotinal to mathematics

8353,Wonder what this guy was like as a kid
8354,"&quot;Coding is to programming, what typing is to writing&quot;.... Point noted! 99% don&#39;t know that. Kudos to Dr. Lamport - read one of his books in college"
8355,"As a programming I feel VERY COMFORTABLE writing programs for myself, because I KNOW results need to be inspected, and a program might work for 99 of 100 cases, but if you do one obscure permutation of input parameters, a wrong answer comes out! So ideally you have lots of test data to see what comes out. But anyway, only when you need others to USE a program/algorithm, do you worry perhaps there&#39;s bugs you&#39;ve not yet found!"
8356,"&quot;A algorithm without a proof is a conjecture&quot; - I guess some conjectures are more compelling than others. But of course we know the truth of it - people make mistakes - computers mass produce millions of mistakes made-by-humans faster than you can blink an eye!<br>And of course an algorithm can be &quot;perfect&quot;, while the implementation is flawed, and so proving al algorithm is true doesn&#39;t make any given implementation true, even if you test 100 million cases. And then you recall the &quot;Pentium bug&quot; that gave inaccurate calculations on certain numbers, but only certain problems need an accuracy to see the error."
8357,Great guy.
8358,"Never heard of him before. But its clear to me now Leslie is a legend, an unsung hero."
8359,This guy probably has to waste half of his work time explaining complex topics to slower brained humans.

8369,"I don&#39;t understand why they put math and computer science separately. This is like saying revolutionise cooking using food. Pioneers of the field were all mathematicians. As everyone else have pointed out he drew a connection between the concept of relativity to algorithm design to handle distributed system, so it&#39;s more like physics and applied maths. I thought Quanta has a good reputation as a science communication publication? Did they deliberately put misleading title in order to bait readers?"

8374,If Jesus died for our sins then why was Satan created because he wants you to follow his steps and be sinful! Islam is the truth!
8375,"Math is hard for me as a programmer because it feels counterintuitive to my goal while writing code. Clean and easily readable code can be basically understood by a non developer, but math is not the same. A similar math problem changes based on the context and it&#39;s a lot of symbols that represent symbols that represent other symbols and so on to where it just gets confusing. I feel dyslexic trying to read math problems, so it immediately kills my interest in understanding certain problems. If there was a better way to represent them that was the standard, I&#39;m sure it would be more appealing."

8399,"@GH1618 Yeah, I am aware he&#39;s a legend in the Math and Computing arena. But he never reached legendary public status the way Einstein did, he deserves similar public admiration for his contributions."

8414,Computer Science and Math have been intertwined from the very beginning (just open a book by Donald Knuth). The title is misleading in that it implies that there was no math in Computer Science until Leslie Lamport brought it in.
8415,How can you train on his TLA language? Is there way to get a some instruction or training material to work?
8416,Thank you Sir for sharing your knowledge. Thank you very much.

8418,"The title of this video is too generalized. A counter-example is David Gries, who wrote The Science of Programming, which showed how to use mathematical pre- and post-conditions to prove programs correct and to prevent bugs. While it hasn&#39;t caught on (because the technique was only shown manually and not implemented on computer), this is the pinnacle of applying mathematics to computer science, in my opinion. Even though conceptually simpler, it rivals in potential future practical use even Lamport&#39;s wonderful theories of distributed programming."

Many of my kids in calculus have a complete lack of the intuition when it comes to <b>why</b> we implement certain algorithms. They are only equipped with a hammer and told everything is a nail. Not because they weren&#39;t curious or interested but because their previous teachers could not convey why, say, the quadratic formula was important, what the intuition behind geometric postulates are, or why algebraic properties are the way they are."

You had better inform my client, for whom I am currently finishing off my third programming language compiler for. In the meantime, I suggest you start with looking up the definitions of syntax, grammar and semantics."
8465,"@Andy L the &quot;read BNF part&quot;  just shows you don&#39;t what you&#39;re talking about, the BNF is just a formal notation on how the parser works in a nutshell, it&#39;s basically tells you that keyword should be followed by that one and maybe 2 before it, it&#39;s just a nice way to present things in the most easy part to grasp(the BNF was heavily used 20 years ago in the golden days of java, it&#39;s no longer a practice that is followed as much), the hard part is the implication of what you&#39;re doing, hence the grammar, i don&#39;t think you know what the word grammar means, iam used to fake profiles responding, you used too much words, basically you said, you&#39;re wrong he&#39;s right with no argument to back your claim, and with ego part, if i don&#39;t understand a language rules, it&#39;s not me that is not intelligent enough to grasp it, it&#39;s the language that is badly designed, all languages have their strong and bad parts, there is no well designed or badly designed languages(specially in the popular ones), languages have golden days and they die after like i said, java was the thing to know 20 yeas ago, after that C sharp raise some interest, Python followed it, Python now is the language to know, people that are highlevel in programming a successful working developers, are all getting to know RUST .. and cycles goes on"
8466,"Grammar is easy, just learn to read BNF. You seem to be talking about semantics and not grammar. I think he is bang on with his writing analogy - you’re just trying to write in terribly badly designed languages, and suffering as a result. Not all languages are like this."
8467,"i don&#39;t agree on the part writing/coding, maybe for him what he&#39;s saying is true, but 100 per cent of people i know around me and i see on the internet the hard part in computer languages is the grammar, and you could see even the most knowledgeable people on it make some mistakes defining where the hard part is, let take Python, everyone in the Python community boast about the simplicity of the language, actually it&#39;s not true, it&#39;s an elegant language, but it has very hard parts, the multiple inheritance, the weird super function that behaves in a weird way, the namespace, everything is managing objects namespaces you can hack an object namespace ... the hardpart is the grammar, you could say that for Javascript too .."

It is no coincidence that only afterwards, after I initiated this, they built, built and are building those inventions thanks to my impetus! They sell my ideas (inventions) as theirs! They are not the inventors, but the first technical implementers of my ideas (=inventions)!

8494,"I Think You &amp; Dennis Ritchie Should Get A-lot More Credit Than You Do, Although You Have Received Some Credit, Most People Don&#39;t Even Know Who Dennis Ritchie Was. Thank You."
8495,"it is correct when  you say that all courses of programming languages  merely teach people how to type the prgramming languages correctly accoding to the syntax and semantics, but not how actually to write a computer programm  because you have to have good knwledge of maths <br>That is why there is a huge difference between a computer programmer and a computer scientist in which the scientist does not need any computer to  be stll able to write a computer programme, whereas a computer programmer has to use a computer to do so<br>However , it is not the difference of notion of time perceived by 2 different observers of the same phenomenon or same info that makes transmitting info possible as how you have put it here because the reason why different locations on the Eearth have different time dialation is that human -invented concept of time is totally based on the endless rotational motion of the Earth about its imaginry axis and the effects of sunlight on the Earth&#39;s surface, which means that each point or location is fixed on its surface and when it rotates around its axis and simultaneously moving along its elliptical path around the Sun has a different value of the length of the distance which the point or location has travelled in space. For the circular distance  which is approximately rqual to the circumference around the Earth surface on which the point or location is located , in each complete cycle of sunlight and darkness. So, it depends on your location on the Earth surface whether you see sunlight before or after another human located on another point or location on the Earth to have the perception that your location&#39;s time is ahead or behind the other human&#39;s local time <br>In other words, human-invented concept of time is actually human descriptions or subjective interpretations of how all forms of matter or existence observable to human limited knowledge of the universe change their physical structures and positions in space basing on the repeated changes of the  Earth&#39;s position along its repeated loops of endless and rotational motion around its axis and the Sun, and using human-invented concepts of mathematics, such as those of number systems to represent the scalar values of such travelled distances which today are called as senconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years of which all the numeric values are corresponding to different distances which the Earth has travelled along its repeated path. Ex, one year is corresponding to the length of distance in space which the Earth has travelled around the Sun in a complete orbit. So, the concept of time  merely represents symbolic  values or unreal values which are orginated in the distances which the Earth has travelled in space along its repeated path, and which are real vaues<br>That was why i said quite a while ago that human-invented concepts of  space and time are actually the same phenomenon in objective reality without any human subjective interpretation <br>It requires good knowledge of physics and chemistry to understand that there is actually not any difference between human-invented concept of time and concept of space. That is why i agree on Einstein&#39;s idea that space and time is one, although i disagree on the idea of his theory of general relativity which is merely his own subjective interpretation<br>Human-invented concepts of mathematics can obviously be well-applied to some fields for human purposes , but they can also mislead human developments toward blind beliefs confining human beings in stubborn ignorance because they are extremely limited and can only represent what human limited knowledge can observe and intepret in a certain way, but not any sort of  universal standard foundation for human to be able to use to understand everything. That is why you can never tell how much specifically infinity is, what  scalar values are the ending digits of irrational and transcendental numbers"

Whatever hapened to any British people in the quest for a &#39;computing device&#39; where Americans, i.e. U.S.A. will ever admit to. and I know what happened post WW2. Now I say this and I&#39;ll name utter pioneers in computing, and all of them British. 1) Charles Babbage. 2) Lady Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron. 3) Alan Turing and Blechley Park. Who ever views this can go on any U.K site, NOT U.S.A. sites and find the actual definitive truth."

8518,we being serious here dude 😅
8519,Leslie Lamport joined Microsoft over 20 years ago.  It is a shame he hasn&#39;t managed to coinvince them that writing software that works is pretty important.
8520,He is Satoshi Nakamoto!
8521,"Not legitimately.  A scientist does research.  No BSc qualifies one for doing research.  People with a BSc in physics drive cabs.  I have a BS and MS in CS, but I don’t call myself a computer scientist.  I was a software engineer."
8522,Kinda yeah
8523,"Very interesting, so can I call myself a Computer Scientist when I graduate from University with  BSc in CS?"
8524,Thank God for &quot;white privilege&quot;.
8525,"Last night I slept thinking are there geniuses in the world that go about laying layers of foundation, so that a revolutionary technology is built on their research?

8529,What a great humble genius.
8530,"So when you go faster than the speed of light, you have separated yourself from reality forever?"
8531,This was common sense in the early days of computer science. I think the problem began when the programming languages became abstracted out to the point that they were totally removed from the electromechanical engineering and mathematical theory that made their existence possible.
8532,❤️❤️❤️
8533,Why have I never heard of this man?
8534,Big deal!  Al Gore invented the Internet!!!  😶

8538,"&quot;if people are trying to learn programming by being taught to code, well, they are being taught writing by being taught how to type. And that doesn&#39;t make much sense&quot;"
8539,"I learned something new, thanks."
8540,Impressive and motivational.
8541,@clash o clan The logic and math you use in most programming jobs is usually very basic. The high level math cs college programs require is never actually used on the job.
8542,"Then you go into humanities, you should have a good understanding of math if you wanna be in a field of technology and science."
8543,"@crisvis <br>But math teaches logic, logic is important for when you&#39;re telling a computer what to do."
8544,​@Hmm Hm I agree. Programming in web development does requires basic arithmetic. So basic that you won&#39;t even realize you&#39;re using math most of the time.
8545,"You don&#39;t even use high level math in most programming, unless you&#39;re doing something computational related. In most programming fields all that&#39;s required is basic arithmetic (adding, subtraction, multiply and divide)."
8546,So he is the reason i cannot get into a cs program without math
8547,"L Lamport, we are very grateful you exist! You&#39;ve contributed for the progress of human kind. People like you makes me proud of being a human."
8548,Computer science is math. What he did was revolutionize computer science with physics.

8575,I hope he has many smart children like him
8576,"Nice, this exactly how I do programming! Feeling good."
8577,And i have been sleeping in physics classes till this date 🤦‍♂️
8578,"&quot;stumbled on it&quot;... Oh ya, he just stumbled on it.. he is not a genius .... Legend Lamport 🔥🔥🔥"
8579,I loved this because it&#39;s so intuitive and yet so missed by today&#39;s rush to code.
8580,You all are speaking about TLA+ or latex but he became of really great importance after coming out with logical time concepts where systems are dependent on causality relationship rather internal concurrent events.
8581,"One definition of &quot;coding&quot; might be translating ideas into codes, but these days it&#39;s virtually synonymous with &quot;programming&quot;. Teaching people to code is not analogous to teaching people to type. No one hands you a program and says, &quot;code it up for me&quot;. To write programs, you have to understand the problem and have strategies for solving it. This often involves inventing (or reinventing) algorithms and being able to express your ideas in a programming language.<br><br>Just like with writing novels, the more you write, the more of yourself you put into &quot;The Art&quot;."
8582,Before I clicked on this I thought for sure they were going to be talking about Donald Knuth
8583,Most of CS is math... <br><br>Journalists are parasites.
8584,"That explanation towards the end about the assumptions most algorithms make that his bakery algorithm doesn&#39;t is pretty hand-wavy. Without doing further research I can&#39;t understand what it is he&#39;s talking about. Is he still using &quot;printer&quot; as a shared resource, or is he talking reading numbers simultaneously? The irony is that he criticizes math education in the US and does the same exact thing that makes math education so awful."
8585,"Leslie is truly a genius in the Einstein sense, not just high IQ, but a highly creative individual. Just notice how he intertwines one idea with Einstein E=MC2 and with the French painter Renoir. Scientists of great intellect rely on broad stokes to explain their works. How lucky we are to see their mind at work."
8586,En la República Argentina el idioma oficial es el castellano
8587,i did not even understand the problem he solved. I should stick to dog videos.
8588,Thanks Quanta Magazine for bringing about these great stories from such great minds to the public

8605,"This guy is stating something very insightful, while studying computer science at the University I have been introduced to the Curry-Howard correspondance (look for  it in Wikipedia) which states that basically a computer program is a proof of a mathematical theorem it can be formulated like this : <br><br>In programming language theory and proof theory, the Curry–Howard correspondence (also known as the Curry–Howard isomorphism or equivalence, or the proofs-as-programs and propositions- or formulae-as-types interpretation) is the direct relationship between computer programs and mathematical proofs."
8606,"So inspiring, thanks!"
8607,And he&#39;s such a cutie!
8608,Epitome of intelligence
8609,ya this is what functional programming is all about: applying category theory concepts (the maths) to programming so as to use formally verified constructs and abstractions for computer logic. Haskell is tailor made for this.

8613,"Very informative, though maths has always been an integral part of the development of computer science, going back to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. It formed a large part of the work of Alan Turing himself."
8614,"@blue light addict  Logic has LITTLE to do with math. You can be adept at figuring out how things work and have little or no knowledge of math. Now, can logic help you to understand math? Absolutely! But there are different levels of logical ability. Some people understand mechanics, some understand program flow, etc."
8615,"Logic is fundamentally mathematical thinking (or perhaps mathematics is fundamentally about logical thinking). Lamport mentions in this video that early mathematical education in America is pretty terrible, and more than likely he&#39;s expressing the common sentiment among mathematicians that mathematics education doesn&#39;t actually include any mathematics (a huge part of which is proving theorems)."
8616,"@Spysynth  It may be because I included (dot N E T) in my answer. I recommend this framework for networking, it is compile at runtime and can be written in many different languages, including Java."
8617,@Rick Pontificates i can&#39;t see them
8618,@Spysynth not sure if my responses are being added. I don&#39;t see them. But I am replying
8619,"As a programmer myself, LOGIC is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of programming.<br>Math isn&#39;t always used in code, but logically understanding the steps to make something happen, ALWAYS MATTERS"
8620,"very nice video, thank you so much."
8621,I love the way the first line of modern code they show is a person updating a favicon :)
8622,I like it when ideas in one field are used to solve ideas in another field. His inspiration for solving the distributed database problem(a CS problem) came from relativity in Physics. Interesting.
8623,Q: What do you call a negative one sitting all alone in an empty room? &quot;overnumerousness&quot;
8624,"He really didn&#39;t explain the mutual exclusion algorithm well.  What does he mean it doesn&#39;t matter if the number read is 49, 100, or 4900, 9982?   If the number doesn&#39;t matter, then why does any process even pick a number to begin with?"
8625,"true he is very simple and humble and that statement says it , maths is no invention it&#39;s a discovery , he says he was lucky to stumble upon , for that to happen one needs full presence in the moment , and this man masters it truly , he know every human have a average of 70yrs to live and in that time , what we contribute will matter , more or less big or small , and our arrogance pride and ego will be of no relevance , such people who have achieved so much have done so many big things are still really humble and that&#39;s the trait which is not very common , people often brag and live with pride of their small wins and fail to rise above it , we are all very small creatures contributing in a bigger consciousness so let&#39;s do our best , i am a cs student and i admire this guy a lot"
8626,Yes I had an exam of Distributed Systems and now I know the genius behind those algos.
8627,The background video is of such OLD hardware!  Is that supposed to be the context of his work?  I don&#39;t think so.
8628,He also created Bitcoin

8657,@Len Cumbow totally irrelevant quotes from Lamport and Guindon.

8667,are you new to youtube?
8668,"The title of this video is actually ridiculous. It&#39;s like saying &quot;The man who revolutionized literature with words.&quot; It suggests that Lamport came along and said, &quot;Hey, guys, how about we use math!&quot; and nobody had thought of this idea before. Computer science is an inherently mathematical field. All computer scientists use mathematics all the time and always have done. Computer science was invented by mathematicians like Church and Turing before digital computers even existed.<br><br>Every innovation in computer science uses math. So your title is equivalent to just &quot;The man who revolutionized computer science&quot;. And, sure, I&#39;ll go with that: Lamport did a lot of really important work. &quot;A man&quot; would be better, since there are many others beside him."
8669,There are so intellingent people out there ...feel stupid now
8670,Oh shut up
8671,I&#39;m really pissed off that I discoverd the beauty of math too late. I should go back to elementary school math and re-learn everything from scratch. But I simply don&#39;t have the time to do it anymore :(
8672,The Man Who &quot;Revolutionized Computer Science&quot; not knowing about Quantum Physics ;)<br>Killroy was here :P
8673,"great video but so many unrelated cut  scenes , hard to understand what he is saying"

8681,Thank you so much
8682,This is so inspiring🙌
8683,"Procedural Programming, C is The Best Example, is much like speach, you learn to speak in a very logical language! You write in your native language The Program Specifications, what it needs to do, how it interacts with users, possibly with other Systems too, and then you translate it to functions, to Procedural C. I find things much easier to then visualise where Classes are needed, if Object Programming is required. This is The Best way i have found to work in my case, very straight-forward, easy to follow, transparent!"
8684,"Lamport (1941..) receiving a Turing Award may have been overdue and he is a genius, of course, but he did wasn&#39;t the first or only one to apply insights from mathematics or formal logic to coding/programming. Robert Floyd, Tony Hoare. Edsger Dijkstra (1930..2002). Theoretical physicist by training, university professor for much of his life, a godfather of structured programming, 1972 Turing Award (the first to a non-British, non-USAnian)."

8714,@Jerome Arenas hallelujah Jerome 🌝
8715,"That&#39;s why they teach you Maths, logic and algorithms in CS"
8716,@Abdelmalek Belahbib What I meant was it might actually be useful to just type code as an instructor goes along. <br><br>I compare it to when learning a new natural language by just repeating phrases an instructor says until you can remember enough phrases to carry on a conversation even if you don&#39;t understand the pieces of the phrase.
8717,@64standardtrickyness well nobody said you need to write down every line of code by yourself. There is no harm in copy pasting some piece of code as long as you know what it does. But the real challenge is when you face real problems where you have to come up with a solution that you can&#39;t find online
8718,"&quot;If people are trying to learn programming by being taught how to code, well they&#39;re being taught writing by being taught how to type, which doesn&#39;t make much sense&quot;<br>But this makes much more sense !"
8719,I’d say “studies computation”
8720,To me the term computer science is misunderstood by most people. A computer scientist is someone who studies computers but not what they do. &#39;Computer science&#39; I regard as the science of processing information and got nothing to do with computers. In this case the computer is but a tool to process information. Mathmatics is a science encapsulated in itself. It has no link to the real world and is completely an abstract child of the human mind. Whereas physicists use mathmatics as a tool for their approximations of what they call reality.
8721,I learned the lamport bakery algorithm in my parallel computing class
8722,"this TLA+ sounds awesome, I&#39;m so glad I stumbled upon this!"
8723,Bravoooo 👏👏🙏👏
8724,I didn&#39;t understand anything he said but I think he is one of all the butterfly effects out there.
8725,Lovely
8726,This is the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time. This inspired me and pulled me out of the scholastic rut I’ve been in for the past 2 weeks.
8727,"Great video, abhorrent title. CS is inherently an extension of mathematics, while the title makes it sound like combining the two is the groundbreaking idea making Lamport&#39;s ideas notable."
8728,And what an humble person he is!
8729,"@GH1618 I can&#39;t deny theoretical possibility of this, but when you actually have to implement and support some kind of software..."
8730,There is no conflict between writing code which is mathematically sound and which is easy to understand and maintain.
8731,"Thinking mathematically is one of the sins in software development. People just stop thinking consciousness and instead of making easy to maintain user-friendly modules, they do something in sake of its &quot;mathematically completeness&quot;. And the business OF COURSE demand something that contradicts this whole constructed nonsense, and things getting ugly really fast...<br>Im so tired of cleaning mess these people leave after them."
8732,He explains multiple groundbreaking discoveries here so succinctly!
8733,"What book is show at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=0m33s"">0:33</a>?"
8734,"Daemn, you could listen to this guy in 2 hours and he still has things he could talk about that are interesting to you. You can hear knowledge and experience from his voice"
8735,Actually (too) many problems in man&#39;s creation can be condensed down to a few kernels. It&#39;s nowhere more apparent than in mathematics. Of which it appears that the semblant varieties of problems and solutions only appear to be separated by paradigms.
8736,If his algorithms are theorems with proofs so his programs has no bugs?
8737,That was a profound intro. LOL. Its like...one day out of the blue you come to a massive realization that you have been a computer scientist this whole time. Proceeds to grow epic beard
8738,Deceiving title: everyone who revolutionized computer science did it with math. In a very deep and very real sense computer science is math.
8739,programming is about problem solving! that is what I have been teaching for more than a decade.
8740,Amazing new information
8741,I really like the way your content is enriched with stuff which makes me intrigued in that stuff. Like I am not really able to explain the depth of it. But hope you understand. :D
8742,I mean... a math problem can be solved by math but I don&#39;t understand how logic problems can be solved by math. You teach them to program to understand logic. You teach them math to understand algorithms. Maybe algorithms is all he thinks programming is or should be? 🤷‍♂️ As a programmer I feel like this is a really weird argument to make.
8743,"I want to point out that the coding-typing and programming-writing analogy is quite weak, because actually creating typed texts is a very big part of the learning process for writers."
8744,He is a good speaker! Few people give a presentation I can stay focused on: I wonder if he gives regular presentations. TPP
8745,"As a STEM tutor who is primarily a programmer but also loves all stem fields, the comment he made about coding to programming is the same as types is to writing is such a sad truth. Too often I have encountered individuals who can code but cannot program at all. I have had to teach them how to think, since teaching them how to code is as simple as teaching them how to Google. Learning how to program means learning how to approach a problem and ask yourself the right questions to find the solution in your mind. The rest is trivial."
8746,The humility of a real scientist
8747,thank you for sharing with us
8748,"This dude is brilliant 👏 now I have a better understanding to my approach to ai, math cs."
8749,Coding is to programming what typing is to writing - Wonderful!
8750,Lamport’s causality principles are bedrock of distributed systems on which the world runs today.
8751,"wow, thank you!"
8752,So this guy made Computer Science inaccessible for people who find math hard. I was super excited to major in CS but having to learn Calculus made me hate the whole thing. I hate you Leslie. I truly do.
8753,Whar are you talking about?! <br>Computer Science <i>is</i> Math.
8754,He&#39;s a very sympathetic person. I suddenly wanted to be friends with him. He has such bright feeling he leaves on you...
8755,Great story!
8756,🤦🤦🤦
8757,Really best human ❤️
8758,This dude brought my gpa down so much
8759,He reminds me of the guy on Ready player 1
8760,In my last year of university I did a research paper on the comparison between the work of dines bjørner and tla+ by Leslie lamport. The work of these two men in specification language is astounding and unfortunately the only conclusion I was able to reach is that one semester isn’t enough time to really get deep enough into it.
8761,"The fastest Blockchain in the world, Solana, uses Lamport clocks along with cryptographic constructs to allow nodes all over the world to agree on the order of events without communicating. This is what allows such a high transaction volume and is so integral to Solana that the base unit of the SOL cryptocurrency is called a &#39;lamport&#39;."
8762,What a brilliant man

8769,"Math is a tool and we are lucky to have it. I&#39;ve struggled with math all my life but it has allowed me to do so many things. I think once you accept you don&#39;t understand something you can figure out what is holding you back. Take each part and simplify it and move on to the next. If you find a teacher isn&#39;t explaining it for you to understand, find someone else that can. I find using audio books helps me as well as visually working out the problem. And most importantly, be kind to yourself."
8770,"Ah, I&#39;d love to meet with Dr. Lamport some day; he sounds quite the polymath and maths-are-of-course-humanities person. The elegance with which he describes the laxity (lack of requirements) in his approach remind me of the beauty in the minimizations of e.g. axioms in Reverse Maths. My works through MetaMaths have led me to be very humbled by the surprise of some beautiful mathematical objects I&#39;ve palpated; the look on his face and tone of his voice is all-too-familiar and says it all."
8771,Um Computer Science is literally born out of Maths tho? <br>You need to change the title to give credit to the true genius of this man.

8839,@Jaosn Fuller <br>This is computer science not just programming
8840,"@Mike G yes, you don&#39;t need a degree math to perform complex software engineering, but that&#39;s only because other people figured out how to do that complexity and break it down and us simpletons can just pass a couple variables into a function that does all the work for us."
8841,"@Jaosn Fuller Sure, if you want to get down into the weeds with assembler.  But there’s hardly ever any need to get down and dirty any deeper than a language like C.  Or, more currently, Python. When writing code, I was always “defensive.”  By this, I mean that if I or someone else needed to return to it and figure it out, I made it as straightforward and as linear as possible.  That said, there were times when lines of nested functions got pretty hairy and took a while to untangle even with decent internal documentation.  In my earlier post, I was simply trying to point out that you don’t need an advanced degree in math to do some pretty significant and complex software engineering."
8842,"^this.  the only thing you can do in programming is add, subtract, multiply and divide.  It takes some decent intelligence though to be able to break down complicated equations into simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Sure we have functions now that people have made so we don&#39;t have to break it down ourselves, but if you look into those functions, which sometimes call other functions, which sometimes also call other functions, you find the equation always gets broken down into simple parts."
8843,"The only math background you need in programming is to add, subtract, multiply and divide.  Unless you consider Boolean algebra to be math. Technically, i suppose that it is.  But the professor here is making things much more complicated than it needs to be.  An algorithm is simply a plan to solve a problem.  People of ordinary intelligence can do this."
8844,"The world has been run by conmen for a looooooooong time..They permeate the &#39;culture&#39; from within, and don&#39;t even know it themselves!..<br><br>&quot;Mathematics has the completely false reputation of yielding infallible conclusions. Its infallibility is nothing but identity. Two times two is not four, but it is just two times two, and that is what we call four for short. But four is nothing new at all. And thus it goes on and on in its conclusions, except that in the higher formulas the identity fades out of sight.&quot;  <br>  (Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe)"

8853,Goedels incompleteness theorem must drive this guy nuts. There are numerous algorithms which are known to work but for which no proof can be constructed. Most of these revolve around recursion and self-reference.
8854,"what most people don&#39;t know is that Leslie Lamport is 29 years old, and he looks old due to working on something called debugging."
8855,Wow 😮 everything is connected. MC^2 solved an unrelated problem!! Cool 😎
8856,Compurize a slide rular to equate the function
8857,The reason you separate th riemann zeta function is a program of quantum computers solve infinity at a long memory
8858,"Algorithms without proof are conjecture... Ah, UST should have been called a conjecture stablecoin... Words are important.."
8859,Lamports logical clock is the term I remember his name from. Very elegant and simplistic.
8860,"Thanks, a wonderful exposition of humility."
8861,There are a lot more people who revolutionized CS than just this guy.
8862,"@Patrick Moore Trust me, if you have big ambitions rather than doing some tedious &quot;enterprise database app&quot; or &quot;websites&quot;, maths is very essential."
8863,"That isn&#39;t what he says, and shouldn&#39;t be the take away. A deep knowledge of mathematics might help you see computer science in a unique way, but it isn&#39;t necessary."
8864,"I wish I could hear these words 20 years earlier, what a wise man! It took me a very long time to figure out one can not do decent software works without deep knowledge of mathematics! There is no way around this."

8866,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=1m17s"">1:17</a> Leslie Lamport &quot;People confuse programming with coding. Coding is to programing what typing is to writing.&quot;"
8867,"It&#39;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=5m39s"">5:39</a> in the video. This guy is obviously a genius. You don&#39;t see those that often. He&#39;s explaining it and if I tried to explain it it would just be herr derr. This man stumbles onto world changing concepts. Woops, I just tripped over another thing that will change computing forever."
8868,I have no clue what this man just said but it was absolutely fascinating. Good show ol&#39; chap.
8869,"Having a B roll of data centers in a video about a Computer Scientist that considers learning programming with programming languages like learning writing by learning to type, is analogous to having a video about a Pulitzer winning writer and having a B roll of a type writer factory."
8870,Cardano ADA will change everything.
8871,"To the majority of humans, a boxer who is an expert on knocking people to the floor is worth much more than an unknown genius like Lamport.<br><br>What does that say about humans?"
8872,A living legend
8873,Is this tue same dude of Lamport&#39;s law in distributed computing ?
8874,He seems cool.
8875,amazingly inspiring! This kind of people makes me wanna better myself.
8876,He wouldn’t get past the first interview. “Too academic”…
8877,This guy would be fired on day 1 in most corporations. Complete lack of math/science approach in those circles...
8878,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> why on earth would you put HTML in such video! Lol"
8879,My favorite research paper of all time is the part time parliement by Leslie Lamport. I was fascinated by the research field of distributed computing.
8880,what a nonsense title. Computer science has always been just an application of math
8881,I&#39;m really proud that I&#39;ve stumbled on it...<br><br>Now that&#39;s humility.
8882,"The idea that engineers don&#39;t or can&#39;t think mathematically is idiotic !  Another self agrandesing, self teaching,  gray beard; here to tell you what he believes he has learned.  Nice set , but that apple 1 he is typing away on is archaic!"
8883,The state machine is a reentrant lock
8884,"So much of the software I write is user interface code.  The &quot;beauty&quot; (if you want to call it that) is mostly in the presentation, not the code.  But, having the chance to design and implement algorithms is a real treat.  That&#39;s when I feel I&#39;m getting closer to programming."
8885,When genius humbleness coalesce into a singularity of inspiration !
8886,"I really have no idea what he&#39;s talking about in that last part of the video, what assumption? He should explain it better."
8887,You don&#39;t really know him until you read a Paxos paper.
8888,This kind of videos is the reason why I stopped watching TV and switched to YouTube…. Only Nova and a few channels can afford this type of content.
8889,Just amazing. Thank You Quanta Magazine for putting these ideas into my mind and making me think. And thanks to this wonderful gentleman for making the world a better place.
8890,This last semester I took a distributed systems class and implemented Lamport and vector clocks. And designed systems using a particular consistency model using them. Really awesome to see the legend that described these first!
8891,"Bravo! I need to refresh my math skills, what an inspiration!"
8892,what time is it Leslie? 🥰
8893,&quot;When I wrote the proof I never needed to make the assumption&quot;
8894,Good content
8895,what a badass!
8896,Well latex is still better than Word.<br>Formal verification is used for may real time critical systems like Air Traffic schedulers <br>Paxos...yea I agree.
8897,- LaTeX is a shitty editor. <br>- Formal verification has had very little impact on the industry over many years. <br>- Paxos is overcomplicated compared to Raft.
8898,Thank God for the Meta-Stable state.  Newbies get screwed every generation.
8899,Cache Coherency  is a big problem.  LOL
8900,so much intelligent men and an infinite number of bugs at the systems...
8901,"Termination?! I’d say they would be up for a Turing award, but he got there first :)"
8902,I suppose their software will be bug-free.
8903,Imagine if every programmer wrote a proof of correctness and termination for their functions.
8904,As a software engineer I kinda felt like he was taking a shit on me.
8905,Dam he is smart
8906,Same.
8907,s
8908,"@Patrick Moore It is often the case on big discoveries, a few years late they sound like familiar and obvious stuff. Like...  engines, people are used to them now but it was new and unheard not that long ago. I am sharing a quote from Napoleon, the French general &quot;You would make a ship sail against the winds and currents by lighting a bonfire under her deck? I have no time for such nonsense&quot;. Likewise young people are teach of &quot;machine state&quot;, it&#39;s a familiar concept now."
8909,"@Luis Mailhos sorry if you’re not actually a bot (lol), but what did he get a prize for that was simple and basic and well known by 2022? The well known by 2022 part makes no sense. You just sound like a bot."
8910,@Patrick Moore ???
8911,bot
8912,It&#39;s amazing he got prizes and fame for discovering such simple (and well known by 2022) and basic stuff. Well done!
8913,How is someone motivated to pursue this
8914,There are tons of great people in CS. And sounds like you are one of them!
8915,"I love this guy!  We need more people like this in computer science these days,"
8916,Amazing video
8917,"@R but unless you stay in academia, you probably won&#39;t use it again.  Why would you?"
8918,Word is for kids. <br>I wrote mine in latex
8919,I had to write my PhD thesis with LaTeX - what a PitA.  Would&#39;ve vastly preferred Word with Equation editor 3.0.
8920,He stumbled on it because he wrote the mathematical proof.  That is his message.
8921,why does he look like a deepfake
8922,I have no idea what he was taking about at the end…
8923,Sometimes I think I&#39;m a computer scientist... Then I watch these videos. And then I realize I&#39;m ignorant.
8924,"Very informative and inspiring video, I&#39;m glad I found this channel!"
8925,This was great.
8926,"Of course he uses a thinkpad, he knows what he is doing."
8927,"So he basically invented information teleportation within languages that support it, at least in a human level of perception.<br>Hey, I implement that as much as possible all the time.<br>Thanks, guy!"
8928,Don’t argue anymore ! We can agree tht math is the culprit
8929,I feel so too but because it&#39;s the only line I could understand.
8930,"Ofcourse what he said is absolutely right...coz if you are typing without knowing the purpose, logic and procedure...then you are simply copying it from somewhere that&#39;s it."
8931,Exactly man. Now I have existential crisis... What is intelligence? If education is just learning how to type and memorize.. then<br>..<br>..<br>..<br><b>shudders</b>
8932,@Alexander Thank you for this comment bro... You deserve a Turing award 😅
8933,"I feel like the most important thing he&#39;s said there is &quot;coding is to programming what typing is to writing, if you learn to program by learning to code, you essentially only know how to type&quot; This! this is something I always try to convey but never found the right words for it, I&#39;ll be using that analogy for sure! :D"
8934,What a wonderful channel!<br>I’m a new fan 👍🏾
8935,Good for you?
8936,I grew up with a talent for maths and found computer programming very natural after high school.
8937,Imagine if we elected smart people to run things. Oh ya we&#39;re not allowed.
8938,"Theres an issue with what was said on relativity, it is not necessarily the case that the ordering of events is agreed upon by different observers. It can be guaranteed in specific cases but its not guaranteed in all. Im sure Lamport understands the issue of the subjectivity of ordering of events as he said that he&#39;d worked and even written a paper involving it, but as its presented in the video its not quite right without some caveats"
8939,Lovely video
8940,his name sounds similar
8941,"If you don’t know monads and functors, you’re just coding. How does programming even work without the coyoneda trick?"
8942,master student insight .... the aha wow effect....
8943,"@Patrick Moore - Nah, the formation of silicon in supernovas came before that, and it undoubtedly forms the basis of modern computing."
8944,Ultimate basis proposition: cavemen counting on their fingers?
8945,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=2m47s"">2:47</a> - As a former coder, I always chuckle when I see the inevitable &quot;[whatever this video is about] forms the basis of modern computing&quot;. And I wonder if I (or anyone) will ever be able to discover something that <i>doesn&#39;t</i> &quot;form the basis of modern computing&quot;."
8946,"When I found it on my recommendation, for a moment I was thinking &quot;Is that THE Leslie Lamport?&quot;"
8947,I&#39;m offended I can like this only once.
8948,THANK YOU
8949,"There&#39;s a circularity (chicken/egg) problem in teaching people to program. It&#39;s very difficult to explore an algorithm or other logical construction to deeper than a hand-waving vagueness without expressing it in a formal language, (which had better be executable if you want to test or correct it). <br>However, to make learning to do that, (i.e. coding) interesting, you have to present enough examples of problems with fairly obvious solutions to get people fluent in the language. It&#39;s like learning to speak, then think, then write, without the basic motivations usually in that process."
8950,Incopmutable amount of respect to this finest gentleman
8951,I don t understand. As a way around counter methods thar get too off track!? A counter cheat that results in ranges of digit formats ?
8952,"Commenting so that the algorithm can show me more such content, so that I can get some respite from all the political madness. 😄"
8953,"Listen up you quanta magazine guys, your channel is fu*king awesome and for undergraduates/research enthusiasts there is no other channel/media like you out there. so dont you dare to shut down ever."
8954,Best channel on YouTube!
8955,Cool!!! thanks for sharing
8956,His genuine pride in his work @ the end is so fucking wholesome
8957,@Luke Amendolara I don&#39;t have qualms with that.
8958,@Michael Pohoreski uh what about like overlapping set or &quot;intersects with&quot;
8959,"@Ritwik Isn&#39;t applied mathematics a very broad term though? Also, do you consider theoretical CS (e.g. theory of computations, algorithms) as a branch of pure mathematics?"
8960,@Michael Pohoreski which willl never happen because cs is not meta maths in any way. It&#39;s a branch of applied mathematics. Even that boundary is being blurred with the advent of purely functional programming.
8961,@Ritwik Neither superset nor subset is accurate.  Superset is the closest thing we have until people adopt Meta-Mathematics.
8962,The title is a little strange (CS was born out of math from the getgo and the interview even mentions that Lamport was inspired by special relativity/physics) but great job bringing attention to a great researcher.
8963,nice
8964,What a wonderfully humble guy.
8965,Idk learning microprocessor from YT would suggest me this masterpiece! 💫❤️🙏
8966,"Dude is 81, I&#39;d expect a little wear and tear (and hope to be half that sharp) when I hit that age. <br><br>I get you, though. Losing John Conway to COVID at about the same age was a bummer, he was also by all accounts both brilliant and a great guy."
8967,"I love using TLA+ and I&#39;m astounded by this man&#39;s contributions to CS. Thanks Quanta, I really enjoyed this video. One question, is he doing alright healthwise? He seemed to be breathing heavily :("
8968,years of working on a problem and he says he stumbled on it. so profound
8969,"Yeah, I mean I actually want to be a musician but I gotta make money somehow in the meantime so software engineering it is. Not everyone loves CS. I don&#39;t hate it, and I&#39;d rather be a software engineer than what I was at my last job (a waiter). But I&#39;m not in love with it either and I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that"
8970,"That&#39;s because there is no need to learn, and neither do companies encourage you to learn. As soon as you start learning, they load you with so much work that you forget whatever you were learning."
8971,"Most people are brought up in a culture of always-online, electronic devices from the outset. The novelty would appear to have worn off to a new generation of peoples. Actually much of what IT does is a reflection of man&#39;s activity and it is at a fundamental level very basic and mundane stuff."
8972,"@Patrick Moore Agreed. Appreciated your response. <br><br>Its an observation. Nothing to do with faulting anyone. <br><br>Maybe a testament to the times we are in? Interesting, the interpretations, the politics to my last comment. <br><br>And to think...30 years ago they warned us if you get into IT then don&#39;t expect a job...<br><br>The irony..."
8973,"@Louis-Alexandre Simard IT will be replaced automated... don&#39;t mix IT with Software engineering though,"
8974,"Love his down to earth, low tech, higher reasoning perspective. <br><br>Executing your ideas, &quot;working&quot; knowledge. That&#39;s what coding is for me.    <br><br>Noticing more often that many new IT people have no interest in IT. They expect to get a job and that&#39;s about it."
8975,Idea - Self learning could be to get rid of new never seen before toxins and junk from the ocean. A self learned chip and sensor could detect new toxins in saliva.

8979,In India hare there is no good math courses only the ISI and IIT has the good course work. But in the community college only tech you the theory that&#39;s all. I left a reputed university in India JU for this perticular reason. I think mathamatics with codeing is a lethal combination so it sould be add to the course work.
8980,"He didn&#39;t use simple basic math, most people don&#39;t take advanced math but, lots of people decide to go into programming. This guy is the father of A.i."

8990,All prograns are proofs (Curry-Howard isomorphism)
8991,"Yeh I have taken a few courses on programming proofs and it was basically Leslie Lamport the book and some other famous people mixed it and while super useful and made writing code feel very safe and correct it isn’t always practical and I write a lot of code today where I just kind of do it instead of proving it first however it is definitely vital when creating a new algorithm but software developers/engineers don’t really do that because they aren’t computer scientists.<br><br>Basically, I agree with you quite a lot."
8992,"&quot;If people are trying to learn programming by being taught to code, well, their being taught writing by being taught how to type and that does not make much sense.&quot;  - So this is partially correct, but as always these things are more complicated when we speak about practicality.<br><br>1. You need to know how to type before you can write, if you cannot type how can you get anything written in the first place?<br>2. Not every part of a program requires this level of mathematical oversight from a practical standpoint.<br>3. Programs are mutable, we can continually improve them over time this also applies to algorithms.<br>4. This applies to a niche place in the industry where we are talking about cryptography, scientific computing, etc. However, this does not include the entire industry.<br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say, is he is correct, but writing proofs all day for very basic menial tasks you will never get your work done, there are things it makes absolute sense to do this and others not so much. Yes, you can write a proof to write &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the screen if a command line argument is present or not, but do we really need to spend a ton of time writing a proof for that? <br><br>So this is not as black and white as one may think, as always it&#39;s more complicated than that.<br><br>This type of mathematical absolutism, while it may sound smart, step back, and look at the practical application and then use it as a tool where it makes the most sense.<br><br>Also apparently he is the creator of LaTeX and for that, thank you, I use it all the time!"
8993,The order of event is the same in any frame. Woww. I did not think this way. So is this the basis of distributed systems
8994,What a humble genious
8995,I completely agree! Coding and programming is like walking whenever you&#39;re trying to go to the store. You got to figure out where the store is at. Walking is just what you doing between
8996,I am so lucky to have watched this! Truly will become a timeless video.
8997,Fascinating. I confess I only knew of him through LaTeX until now.
8998,"@Kalistic Modiani Sometimes, strong typing. 🙃"
8999,there&#39;s a lot of typing in coding.
9000,"I mean, he isn&#39;t wrong."

9002,Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto
9003,@Yevé Debé Yeah the stock footage is totally dumbing it down. It’s really bad. This guy is a genius. Just show the interview. It’s like if you had an interview with Jimi Hendrix and every time he said “guitar” they just showed random stock photos of guitars for a minute. It’s absurd.
9004,"Yeah, especially when he mentions Special Relativity, and that formula is from General Relativity."
9005,It’s a bit of a disservice to this guy when you drop random Apollo 11 and “E=MC2” stock footage all over the interview.
9006,Programming is to translate your ideas into codes and see it comes to life.
9007,"Lamport has clearly accomplished what very few in the world can ever hope for, and he is a brilliant man. I have a challenge for you, though, think that analogy through a little and write a fictional job specification a company would post to hire such a person. Then go on LinkedIn or the like and find a job post looking to hire somebody like that, or even better, find somebody like that, and then tell me where they are in their career (assuming you find a person like that)."

9010,His opinions on the mathematical nature of algorithms and programming/coding education is like listening to a nicer Dijkstra
9011,Huh what ??
9012,the world has to suffer because of people like this
9013,"beautiful, thank you!"
9014,"Can someone please enlighten me what was the thing being shown at time <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao&amp;t=5m15s"">5:15</a> specifically its connection to computer."
9015,Awesome
9016,Amazing minds

9019,It&#39;s amazing when we study what we really love and not what we have to do to survive in our actual society.
9020,"Plus, this guy didn&#39;t revolutionise CS. He just came up with 1 algorithm"
9021,"@Patrick Moore Agreed. Mathematicians are all about gatekeeping. Another trope I dislike is the &quot;ignorant, contemptuous physicist wades into another field a &#39;revolutionizes&#39; it&quot;. Sometimes a rigourous, fresh perspective is useful, but they often are not mindful of all information that is available on a topic."
9022,@Ab Ab I haaaatee the &quot;you have to be a math genius to be good at CS&quot; stigma. Such gatekeeping bullocks
9023,"In addition, people are &#39;afraid&#39; of mathematics as the field has specifically been designed to be intimidating, from its origins until today."
9024,"This guy is certainly a genius. The bakery algorithm is one of the coolest things in computer science. However, he does seem to be a little elitist when it comes to mathematical thinking. Donald Knuth once said of some code of his &quot;I have only proved it correct, not tried it&quot;. Fundamentally all mathematics is merely precision philosophy anyhow and not totally provable, just look to the incompleteness theorems of Kurt Gödel for this topic. Mathematicians like Lamport would do well to be mindful of this state of affairs."
9025,"I graduated with a PhD in Electrical Engineering decades ago. I quickly went into software development on related products. Algorithmics is an expertise that takes a logical methodical mind as well as experience. Sadly today most of the programmers in the United States lack these skills. Most have degrees in horticulture, languages, political science, etc. While I&#39;m sure these are fine degrees, people who enter these fields tend not to be algorithmically inclined. But from time to time I do see one that really impresses me."
9026,"An amazing, passionate interview. Thank you"
9027,Definitely did more for mankind than Putin has done

9034,"His smile is so beautiful, in a way that, he looks at the truth and recognises it. That&#39;s the definition of ingenuity and thus genius."

9041,Absolutely!
9042,"Lamport&#39;s Turing award in 2013 was probably one of the most overdue Turing awards, glad to see his foundational work and the whole field better recognised with such an interview."
9043,The guy might have gray hair but his work is much more recent than the stock movies of ancient computing you used in the clip. It&#39;s misleading.
9044,Why he never solved the reason by Microsoft sucks shows you how hard of a problem that is.

9049,I often ask myself if it is the ingenuity of the men/women of science and math’s which inspires me more or is it their modesty🤔
9050,My hero my and inspiration as a future Computer Scientist i salute you! from Pakistan.
9051,"I stumbled on it long after his paper was written, because I had a problem and that was the intuitive solution. However, if it weren&#39;t for his research I wouldn&#39;t have had that problem to begin with - the systems just wouldn&#39;t have been advanced enough to make the solution intuitive."
9052,"Every other lecture in my distributed algorithms class has his name.<br><br>Also, I didn&#39;t know causal ordering was inspired from special relativity"
9053,@EastBurningRed Thanks ! I tought it was Leslie but was not sure.
9054,That&#39;s George Dantzig
9055,"I heared an amazing story about this guy: Back when he was student, he came late to course and found a problem on the board, so he spent the full week trying to solve it and that was so hard than usual,... until he came up with solution and went next week to teacher telling him he found the solution of the problem and the teacher told him he did not give any one  ! So when he showed him the problem the teacher got embarrassed because that was a conjecture that he wrote on the board !"
9056,Legend.
9057,It proves maths is some high level arts really really high level
9058,What’s the big whoop?
9059,"says programming languages , shows HTML"
9060,He and Djikstra is the reason why the internet and the 3rd industrial revoltion exists. So the title is bit on the simpler side.
9061,"This man is a legend. His work (see &quot;Lamport Clock&quot;) underpins the workings of one of the fastest cryptocurrency networks, Solana, where the smallest units of its native currency are called &quot;Lamports&quot;. Love it."
9062,Indians and their over obsession with god and worshipping ☹️☹️
9063,"The man behind Distributed Systems, our DS course professor used to worship him a lot"
9064,@ABHAY thankyou so much ! Those are very kind words tbh as I haven&#39;t really uploaded my latest works on YouTube but thankyou so much hehe
9065,"Hey philonoist , i just watched ur channel and binged ur videos<br><br>That was worth watching 🙂"
9066,You&#39;re an absolute legend Mr. Lamport ! After watching this I asked one of my friend about Bakery Algorithm and you and ended up knowing a lot about you that includes distributed logical clock algorithm and many more . I&#39;m surprised how I didn&#39;t know about you.
9067,i m impressed
9068,Yes the man who revolutionized computer science is pretty smart.
9069,&quot;natural law&quot;
9070,"@Alice Whites If you want, feel free to ask questions, and I&#39;ll see what I can do. I used terms from physics like &quot;inertial frame&quot; and terms from computer science like &quot;distributed computation&quot; to keep the explanation a reasonable length. A comment board is not the place to put a tutorial, necessarily. But if you want to ask questions, it might benefit others who are new to either physics or computer science, and could benefit from more explanation, even though Wikipedia is there, though it might not connect special relativity and distributed computing as was done here."
9071,"@Patience 🇨🇭 - First off, he is as clear as day in terms of how he explains complex ideas. Second, I think you&#39;ve got a confusion between pure research and applied development of a product or service. You seem to be suggesting that no research is legitimate unless it&#39;s being done in the service of business. Now I&#39;m not opposed to applied work; in fact if you want to make a lot of money, directing your effort to make a specific new product or service is the way to go. But if you want to make a name for yourself as an academic as well as make a contribution to your field, thinking in abstract or theoretical ways like Einstein, or Maxwell, or many others did, enables you to change how people view the fundamental ideas that underlie an area of knowledge. The two database guys were applying their knowledge to solve a problem. It was Lamport who found mistakes in their implementation and ushered in a new way to interpret distributed computing, by way of his mathematical and physics thinking."
9072,@Patience 🇨🇭 Yes he should have done all that so the Chinese can more easily copy it.  It reminds me of the cartoons with bugs bunny where Elmer Fudd yells &quot;Stop running so that I may catch you!&quot;
9073,"No question about it, this guy is a genius. The idea of using a physics-based notion of time like that of relativity, and using that as a metaphor to guide his work in distributed systems and its notions of timing is a really powerful and original way of thinking."
9074,"Haha. Had a friend in college back in late 1980s who was a comp sci major. I asked him once, what the hell he&#39;d do with that major? Many years later, I ended up getting a Master&#39;s degree in comp sci."
9075,"keep telling my  director ANYONE can write a program... it&#39;s like talking  and like talking some people just talk shite...<br>if they do not have a deep understanding of the underlying data and how things might change in the future, what they produce is garbage..<br>but nope... it seems that anyone who cam program is assumed to be a mega thinker, no matter how old they are or what they produced previously...."
9076,wanted more of him its too short
9077,Maybe you guys are genius that you&#39;ve understood what kind of problem he solved 😥i am the only one special with zero brain.. <br>Please make me understood what the old man did..☹️ i am curious too
9078,He is genius and there is no doubt.
9079,"also the analogy coding is to programming as typing is to writing. Ive been programming for years and never even thought about it like that. Always knew i was building projects with code but it just narrows the scope down even more. Leslie was, and is, definitely a genius"
9080,The one that associates distributed systems and general relativity is also genius
9081,That analogy he made with the painter painting outside and finding problems to solve is genius.
9082,Haha. I love how you also thought of Unit tests...
9083,"And yet we use Unit Tests to confirm our programs work correctly, which is very un-mathematically. As experiments are forbidden in maths."
9084,Hopefully Leslie Lamport didn&#39;t make a claim to have revolutionised computer science with maths. Can you tone down the headlines a bit?
9085,"Here, have a 🍪"
9086,Duhh. I know one of them. He solved the bakery problem --- and.. well.. and other stuffs too..
9087,we would have been just fine without him tbh
9088,Jesus saves.
9089,@theMuritz That&#39;s how I end up buying everything on amazon.
9090,"im not clever enough to understand the problems this man solved, but am glad he did."
9091,&quot;I am really proud that I stumbled on it&quot; <br>The level of humbleness......
9092,I face through the same problem early in the programming to learn very_quick!
9093,Coding is to programming what typing is to writing.
9094,It really is amazing how many places his name turns up.
9095,There’s a difference in their the root words “program” and “code”
9096,@SnoopyDoo I guess it depends on whether you consider program design in terms of data structures and algorithms to be part of &quot;programming&quot; or not. Do you consider terms like &quot;software engineer&quot; and &quot;software architect&quot; to be the same role or different?
9097,@Sanjay Singh You&#39;re missing the point. &quot;Programming&quot; and &quot;coding&quot; are just synomous words. He&#39;s trying to make it sound like they are two different things. They are not.
9098,"You must have missed the part where he said that teaching people to program by teaching them to code is like write by teaching people to write by teaching them to type. Being able to think abstractly about general aspects of algorithms and computation is somewhat comparable to how mathematicians think when they write a proof of a mathematical expression. An algorithm whether its a proof or pseudo code is meant to be processed by a human mind. A program implementation of that algorithm in source code is a model of something that can be compiled for a computer. In fairness, while you were doing coding, you were likely also doing algorithm design along the way, but you were doing so in an ad hoc manner, not separating the two and switching among them as you went along. <br><br>Computer science is itself a branch of discrete mathematics, so it stands to reason that the first programmers were originally mathematicians. This is also true of the first computer architects like John Von Neumann. Since then, many different ways of thinking about how to write software have emerged, some rigorous and strict for correctness, and others more flexible and open-ended to be easier to learn and use: object-oriented, declarative, multi-threaded, dynamic programming, functional, etc."
9099,"You know that this guy is old when he thinks that there is a difference between programming and coding. There isn&#39;t. You will never find any job description labeled &quot;coder&quot;. Programmers write code and writing code IS programming. I&#39;ve been programming/coding for 40 years. On a side note, this guy has a fantastic set of hair for someone his age."
9100,nerd!
9101,"It’s certainly a honour to hear about this  amazing groundbreaking work, but I am even more astounded by his humbleness and honesty. Hats off to you Sir !"
9102,"&quot;Well, fuck him then.&quot; - every math major when their classes start requiring it for assignments."
9103,"Nice. I&#39;m learning LaTeX right now, and I am loving it. <br>Thanks, Mr. Lamport."
9104,Impressive...  latex was sooo sexy in The Matrix... 😏
9105,Not just math but almost all physical sciences. I’m in grad school for physics and I use it
9106,Really! amazing.
9107,"This dude also created LaTeX, a software that is commonly used to write mathematics. Impressive individual"
9108,Quite an interesting Cat indeed.
9109,"What&#39;s often neglected when &quot;proving&quot; that a program is &quot;correct&quot; are all the other layers. The requirements, are they correct? (= Never.) The complier, is it correct? The libraries, are they correct? The CPU microcode, is it correct? The embedded processor in the keyboard, is that correct? There are a million subtle dependancies and it is clearly impossible to prove them all correct.<br><br>Coder-drones, Programmers, and even the most illustrious Computer Scientists; they all stand upon the shoulders of imbeciles.<br><br>It&#39;s hubris to believe otherwise."
9110,Microsoft collects computer scientists the way others might collect fine wine.
9111,P1gs are experts in &quot;Lorem Lipsum&quot;.
9112,I wish I had a teacher like him
9113,I love this man
9114,Amazing
9115,Love the comp.sci stuff!!
9116,Thanks for bringing those who create things that we use every day and really do not always wonder where what we use came from.
9117,"@Bii Distributed systems are chaos. Neither computer understands the other simply because a CPU core thread thinks it&#39;s the ruler of its domain and will always assume that and trash everyone else. There&#39;s always some agreed upon middle-ground that lets them sync and Lamport solved it for both internal to a single computer(Bakery), as well as huge thousand computer clusters(Paxos)."
9118,"@MagikWorx order in natural chaotic systems??? That the hell, that sounds cool!!! I wanna check this out"
9119,@Bii I remember Lamport first from the bakery algorithm and then his distributed logical clock algorithm. The man has found order in naturally chaotic systems and I can&#39;t help but admire it. It&#39;s great that they felt the same and could honor him in that way.
9120,"When he kept talking about distributed systems, I couldn&#39;t help but think block chain. But to find out his last name is lamport now shows me how important this man is, the subunit of Sol, on the Solana block chain is a lamport. It&#39;s called a lamport to pay homage to this computer scientists."
9121,"Thank you, Mr Lamport. You&#39;re an absolute legend and I enjoy reading your papers."
9122,@Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari GNU Emacs with his custom macros
9123,@Adarsh Mohapatra That doesn&#39;t  answer what LaTex editor does he use
9124,@Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari He created LaTex
9125,What editor does he use?
9126,"He is awesome. I once wrote an email to him asking what editor he uses for LaTex, he gently replied."
9127,"@B Whittaker I&#39;m not on a high horse I&#39;m just making an observation. The word &quot;Compute&quot; which makes up 50% of the word &quot;Computer Science&quot; means to evaluate mathematical statements. That&#39;s the definition.<br><br>Edit: He even mentioned winning an award from the Turing society, named after Alan Turing. Turing and Alonzo Church are the reason we have modern computers and it&#39;s all based on their mathematical paper called The Turing-Church thesis."
9128,"Get off your high horse. We both know the typical layperson has no idea that math is fundamental. It is, in fact, not in the name."
9129,What this guy did seems to be cool but the title is misleading. By definition all computer science is maths. It&#39;s right there in the name.
9130,"@Saikat Ghosh In that, I agree."
9131,He&#39;s saying that opening up vscode and typing print(&quot;Hello world!!!!!!!&quot;) is different than writing a sorting program that has a worst-case running time of n^2.
9132,"@B Whittaker I understood what he said and even I am talking about the same thing. Software engineering is not as trivial as &#39;typing&#39;.<br>Even after knowing the algorithm and data structure and having the frameworks, coding is not a trivial task. <br><br>I was objecting to his very same comparison. <br><br>Coding is not to programming what typing is to writing. <br><br>(He probably meant to algorithms since coding and programming are synonyms)."
9133,You clearly didn&#39;t listen to what he said.
9134,"@B Whittaker regardless, it is still a joke. Idk why you&#39;re being a hard ass about everything in the comments."
9135,Another academic looking down at coding by comparing it to typing. Wow.
9136,wow thats beautiful
9137,I love how this channel curated and edits videos
9138,He is Satoshi
9139,The shear humility !
9140,Nice vid. Thanks.
9141,Great video - genuinely fascinating.
9142,"Upon hearing his last name, I remembered Lamport clock that I studied back in university. And here is the man himself."
9143,"You guys make the best science videos, please make some more. Thanks for the great channel team ❤️❤️"
9144,"I’m not sure a proof is sufficient for math. For example, Gettier (1963) proved that the traditional definition of knowledge (first <b>written</b> by Plato) is incorrect. That is, sometimes an epistemic agent meets all of the traditional requirements for knowledge, yet still lacks knowledge. Gettier’s paper is concise and sound, but unless proof by contradiction is inherently mathematical, it’s clearly just an Epistemology paper."
9145,"Or, it could be said, he had strong and effective thought patterns that he applied wherever they fit. It may appear as having no approach, when in fact he has a whole suite of good approaches and he rapidly selected the best fit approach.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen some absolute math and engineering geniuses, and that&#39;s the pattern I&#39;ve discerned from them."
9146,@Sanjay Singh you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Why even bother commenting
9147,"If by &quot;accidental science&quot; you mean stumbling into an interesting problem to solve, that doesn&#39;t invalidate the scientific method necessarily. You still have to think like a scientist or mathematician to be proven correct. Lamport proved his ideas with math. Science people see if they can find a counter-example among their observations of Nature. If they cannot find one, they conclude that the model is sound. They may still do mathematical modelling, but it&#39;s a model that accounts for their observations, not one from first principles.<br><br>Poincare the French mathematician once said: &quot;It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.&quot; The scientific method is a form of empirical proof, but the ability to conceptualize or reason about things in new ways provides the key to new discoveries."
9148,What I like about his approach.  He had no approach.  Accidental science works as well as the scientific method.  And in this case better.
9149,"@B Whittaker You misunderstand; I am not saying I expect them to be seasoned. But I think that schools could do a lot more in grounding coders in the correct principles that underlie any good software project. Many of these are universals, and simply go to proper problem conceptualization and decomposition.<br><br>The trend more and more is towards agile. That means we get UI mockups and the request &#39;make it go&#39;. There are more wrong ways to do that than right ways."
9150,"I think most classes take a hybrid approach, teaching students how to code <b>and</b> program using a specific language, depending on the class. One cannot program using a programming language before they learn to code. It’s unsurprising that students don’t graduate with the same level of experience programming as those in the field, and I don’t think it should necessarily be expected they do."
9151,"A truly great mind - respect.<br><br>I have to contend with the issues he raises all the time. Schools turn out coders, which are relatively useless and tend to create more problems than they solve. I have to work with them quite a bit at our company before they develop into programmers."
9152,great! quanta brings me connected with the scientific happening with facinating content
9153,Lov from india
9154,@clash o clan I love Computer science and I don&#39;t hate maths tho but I don&#39;t like it either
9155,Why are you going into a STEM Field if you hate math?
9156,"Meth, not even once"
9157,"Most college students simply use amphetamines, but you do you bestie 😌"
9158,Don&#39;t worry I got through my degree with no methamphetamine! It&#39;s doable!
9159,And here I am thinkin of pursuing computer science with little of no meth
9160,@B Whittaker Some colleges don&#39;t exactly break the bank. My college is free because I&#39;m poor and Florida wants computer scientists apparently. While I was working I was also going to school one course at a time and nearly finished a math degree as well before switching and going to school full-time for computer science.
9161,@God this doesn’t answer my question lol
9162,@God Disability checks pay enough that you can afford multiple degrees and subsist off of them at the same time?
9163,@B Whittaker disability and skill. Money doesn&#39;t ever buy pleasure. Yachts never leave the saucalito dock because the owners never took the time.
9164,"@B Whittaker And, what even bigger dream world can one build in a youtube comment?"
9165,"Thought I&#39;d do college for just the fun of it, going into Pure Math as a first-major. Got my pure math cert mailed this first Quarter, and was a blast, often more than most video games i&#39;ve played for myself. Multimajoring in the sense doing one major at a time. A whole i would like to say i have."
9166,Or are you rather &quot;proud that you stumbled upon it&quot;?
9167,"In a world of stupid things like streamers, this is a blessing"
9168,@Jaydip Naskar it goes both ways son.
9169,"You had not found, AI found perfect for you and also same thing for me....as far our interest. 😎"
9170,im genuinely so glad i found this channel. its got the best videos with comprehensive analyses of the topics they talk about which are completely factual and interesting to hear all the way through! even a 30 minute video feels like 5 minutes on this channel

9567,Your opinion should be pin at top of comment section 🙂

10442,🤢🤮
10443,I already have my degree but this is a fantastic high level overview! Very well done!!!
10444,A useful refresher indeed.
10445,"LOL the science behind the garbage you&#39;ve been writing. Shot me in the heart. Can&#39;t find the lie except that I see CS kids coming out of reputable schools that can&#39;t build stuff and are still struggling after more than a year of working. Still wanna learn though, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. &gt;.&lt;"
10446,"After finishing the video, even as a computer scientist, I still only understand half of what you said. The rest is just a blur."
10447,wow !!!
10448,"This brings me back to all my lectures, good times."
10449,better than 4 years degree lol
10450,Bro make videos on design patterns
10451,"from somebody who programs, this video is actually so succinctly informative"
10452,2022 Nov 16
10453,5 years of programming and i still learned some stuff 👍
10454,"Lmao. Almost spit out my drink on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23101"">#101</a>"
10455,i still don&#39;t know how to fix a printer : (
10456,I check the setting of the video to reduce the speed to normal as I thought I was watching this on 2x
10457,An expression can solve a problem and is more fundamental than a function
10458,"All those months in the school in 13 min, and yet, what a finale!!! Haha the printer!!"
10459,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=9m26s"">9:26</a> omg fortnite!11!11!"

10461,wait how can i fix the printer
10462,I looked away to pick up a slice of bell pepper and now I&#39;m lost
10463,this is actually VERY GOOD
10464,The way he went through all the concepts tells us how well he knows it all.
10465,Great video
10466,This is for ppl that didn&#39;t smoke weed at 13 like me.
10467,DNS = Domain Name System… not Service 😊❤

10474,"A veritable marvel of synthesis,, clarity and pedagogic simplicity"
10475,Love your videos lol
10476,"Ngl, this helped me refresh 2 years worth of my college topics…"
10477,"not sure if i&#39;m sad or happy that i haven&#39;t learned anything new, i guess this just means that my next two uni years will be uneventful"
10478,So true😂
10479,This is my intro to comp sci course in 13 minutes instead of 16 weeks
10480,Wish I knew about this before paying 100k$+ for my uni
10481,The printer one was personal
10482,"Amazing how well made your 101 videos are, great job."
10483,Well explained
10484,Just wow &lt;3 thank you very much
10485,"Thank you to cover it haha!<br>I&#39;m in my first year, and now in a Bootcamp too, I can&#39;t wait to get an internship at big tech"
10486,well... I wish I had this when I started but I will keep watching as a reference as I keep learning. I am really hoping boolean logic is not as big of a deal in the real world. Discrete math kinda kicked me right in the brain lobes.
10487,I never went to college and I&#39;m already very familiar with all of these concepts.
10488,Wasn&#39;t python also compiled tho? I seemed to have heard that somewhere
10489,This is an amazing video. Must have taken a lot of time to do but it&#39;s great!!1
10490,"I found out that I understand every single  concept in this video, but the last one"
10491,i never seen anyone been so honest about my code before
10492,Thanks
10493,This video will go down in history as the best introduction for a student to the world of Computer Science !
10494,Amazing video
10495,Oh man this video is very well put together!
10496,This should be the introductory video for the ones who want to start learning computer science in the school.
10497,Subbed <br><br><br><br><br>As simple as that
10498,"Funny how if kind of learned or get almost anything, but Object-oriented programming just never got in my brain.<br><br>Thanks for this awesome video!"
10499,"Ive said many times that my 4 years in uni couldve easily been condensed into a year without losing anything of value. Ive been proven wrong, apparrently it&#39;s 13 minutes."
10500,4 years of college in one video 😐
10501,Even though I knew them all I came up with an essential idea about my project at work in the end. It&#39;s an inspirational video. Thank you very much.
10502,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=8m25s"">8:25</a> he say it"
10503,"The year is 2035: Advanced AI controls and optimizes every task, fusion has solved the worlds energy problems, humans have become nearly hive-mind and begun integrating with machine. The singularity approaches.<br>Windows still cannot find your printer."
10504,i got lost in kernel shell wait wait! what are you talking about!
10505,"Any good information security channels thats similar to this? Fun, simple and small?"
10506,i knew 90 of these. :) you fixed my imposter syndrome.....for five minutes
10507,This video is funny because I learned most of this stuff in college and forgot it almost immediately upon graduating. Good refresher
10508,Amazing work! You created a time machine! Thanks
10509,I&#39;m a 2nd year SE student.<br>This is insane why tf did I just waste semesters to understand something as simple as this.
10510,This is crazy
10511,My man U just summarized my whole semester
10512,"I did CS in college for a year as a sophomore. I ended up doing a medical drop due to my health and it has been about 4 years since. I had to get on disability because I couldn&#39;t work, so I eventually decided to try and do a bootcamp, to at least hopefully start a career remotely that I can do whether I am sick or not. All that to say I chose a part time 6 month Fullstack Academy web dev bootcamp and it has taught me so much in a very short amount of time. I learned far more in the 2+ months I&#39;ve been in it than the full year of CS classes. <br><br>My CS classes used Java and they did not teach you how to use it at all. It had to be self taught and I did not expect that going into it. It was a huge challenge trying to keep up with learning the language while completing the required work. Most of the students had experience coding already which made their ability to absorb what was being taught way easier. After 4 years I had basically forgotten most of what I had learned syntax wise. So starting the bootcamp I was essentially a noob. But man not to advertise for them, but my instructors are awesome and like I said I have learned so much more than I ever could have alone. At least in a short amount of time like this. I&#39;d say the course itself has taught 95% of these concepts. But I am only 2 months in out of 6 months. So here&#39;s hoping my coding career is fruitful and I can get my life back on track. Good luck to anyone else trying to get into this field!"
10513,my entire degree just flashed before my life!!!!
10514,was hoping q# would be here
10515,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m09s"">12:09</a>     456 :))"
10516,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a> wait what?"
10517,ah yes i see...all of this was for the printer...makes sense ☝
10518,Don’t mind me. I guess I’m just gonn go find  me 2 rocks and start bangin&#39; them together 🦧
10519,rip bob
10520,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=9m20s"">9:20</a> may add that there is also a bottom-ul way of computing said cached values without the incurred stack space due to recursion"
10521,TBH only cs students can link each concept without throwing any  error ✨...
10522,Great
10523,HE SAID THE THING! HE SAID THE THING! HE SAID THE STACK OVERFLOW!
10524,I  Lost you in middle bc i myself am at middle of cs degree <br>But ofcourse a good video summarising the basic important conecept of CS
10525,"Modafoking printers LOL. <br>But seriously your big-endian and little-endian look the same. <br>- Perhaps you did that on purpose, or perhaps you were just lazy, or perhaps it was a glitch."
10526,I&#39;m still in school and can&#39;t figure out the printer or how to undo a big hole in the TV. I think I&#39;m not cut out for this 😕
10527,It’s insane how people took physics principles and materials and turned it into computers.
10528,That&#39;s great. Can you do one about web-development maybe?
10529,you have no idea how much you mean for me
10530,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m08s"">5:08</a> Big and little endians have the same diagram O.o"
10531,You need a degree to fix code?! Maybe that explains why Microsoft visual studio keeps trashing my code.
10532,My dad literally called just a few hours before I saw this video. I need to fix his printer.
10533,"Love this, but your example of big endian and little endian are the same image.  I think the little endian is the incorrect one."
10534,Love it!💯
10535,Called shell because it wraps the kernel🥹
10536,1 Byte is actually 9 bits. 8 Data bits and 1 checksum bit
10537,"Wait, that&#39;s it? Is this all you learn in a CS undergrad program? I know all of this stuff. There&#39;s gotta be more. I don&#39;t know how to use arch linux."
10538,Thank you for your help.😇
10539,Pilots know aerodynamics
10540,What&#39;s the use of character type variable?
10541,"Your videos are just awesome, short but too informative... Appreciate the work."
10542,You just blew my brain 🤯
10543,Where do I get my degree now?
10544,"Why did he end the video at the most complicated subject?? zero help, unsubscribed! &gt;:("
10545,first
10546,I learnt more through this video than through my complete degree. 💀💀
10547,"Pauses at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=2m47s"">2:47</a>.... Woah. XD Christ. That&#39;s half my computer architecture class. xD HAHAHAHAHAHA"
10548,"How is hexadecimal easier than binary though, that&#39;s not why it&#39;s used, unsubscribino"

10550,LOVED IT!
10551,Computer science for retards 😂 I’m dead
10552,This is beautiful.
10553,This is basically rap to me; solid bars

10557,Thanks!
10558,lol that ending was great.
10559,"Great video! 1 question though: did you use the same figures for big and little endian? I wasn&#39;t able to spot the difference there. <br>But again, great summary!"
10560,nice to see IPv4 still getting the nod as the real deal.  after 15 yrs of brow beatings from IPv6 fiends.
10561,your videos are so engaging. So fun to watch.
10562,This man just put 3 years of my life into 13 minutes.... wow 🤣 it&#39;s really only the surface but covered a ton
10563,"One thing that you said that stood out for me that is wrong.<br>It isn&#39;t the computer that has an IP address, but the communication line."
10564,"Short, sweet &amp; very informative"
10565,great video
10566,bruuuh
10567,Finally I have learned how to fix grandma&#39;s printer 🖨️ 😆
10568,101 👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
10569,"The description of <b>back-tracking</b> at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=9m32s"">9:32</a> was a little off. When exploring a graph some programmers teleport (star-trek style) to previously visited nodes. Back-tracking is what you get when beam-me-up Scotty teleportation is not allowed. I think k the best example might be driving a car where road intersections are nodes. When you go the wrong way you can (1) teleport back to the last intersection (that&#39;s not back tracking) (2) you can turn the car around and drive back where you came from. Driving back the same way you came in is backtracking. There are many different vairants of depth-first search and breadth-first-search. Some algorithms save previously visited locations in a stack or queue so that those locations can be teleported to. Backtracking is Flinstones style re-tracing your steps without folding the fabric of space and time. You don&#39;t have to try all possible options or explore all paths in a maze to have back-tracking."
10570,"The only people who can understand your videos are people who already understand your videos. There is no way that a begginer would understand much of what you had to say. It is a real shame that someone with your talents is too busy joking around and showing off to  educate people. Those of us with a college degrees can watch your videos, giggle, and laugh, but someone who just learned about for-loops for the first time is not going to understand your one sentence description of a garbage collector. I majored in math, but I took a lot of Comp Sci courses outside of my major. I learned C++, Python, x86 assembly, and a couple of other languages. I can follow along with your videos and smile at your sense of humor. However, don&#39;t fool yourself I to believing that you are teaching people the basics of programming. I challenge you to stop preaching to the quire and make a video where newbs are the target audience. Speaking at a million miles per minute might draw some laughter, but motor mouth is not educational. Most people with programming knowledge have poor to non-existant video editing skills. Given that you know how to make pretty eye candy, I hope that you will make a college-like lecture on computer programming. Your lectures could have nice animations, and editing, and be much easier to understand than some boring old fart talking for an hour. Currently,you produce computer nerd comedy that only other computer nerds will understand. Novice programmers and left in the wake of your great passing."
10571,"i thought there was only 8 things in programming: +, -, *, /, ., ,, [, and ]"
10572,The amount of times I have smashed my thumbs on the 5/10 sec rewind button to fully understand what was said....R.I.P.
10573,This video is great. Absolutely every programmer should watch this video.
10574,"Nope, in one ear and out the other. trying to force myself to remember it all, but it just goes flows through me like  textbook. PHUQ!!!!!!!"
10575,printers are why I don&#39;t tell people I know anything about computers. They will just think I&#39;m lying anyway.
10576,Awesome!

10587,+fireship 36. Big Endian and 37. Little Endian are the same in your example
10588,stack overflow will not happen if compiler can detect tail recursion and change recursion to the actual loop (aka tail recursion optimization )
10589,At around six minutes i can only hear noises and they make no sense
10590,"very good, Thannk you, Fireship"
10591,"You decode all IT interviews, Very beautiful Job"
10592,So 100 seconds for printers then??

10594,I learn all the code in low minutes
10595,That video was art.. i learned i’m grateful to be doing Javascript
10596,lol sub&#39;d
10597,"As a non-CS person, I&#39;m very proud of myself for knowing and understanding each of the 100 concepts in this video."
10598,"Thanks for this great overview!<br><br>I could be wrong, but my understanding is that memoization is useful in that factorial example primarily if you want to call the same ‘factorial’ function multiple times. I.E. on subsequent function calls you can access values that were calculated and stored in the ‘memo’ dictionary during previous function calls. <br><br>To my knowledge this is a key difference from the benefit of memoization applied to the common application of calculating the Fibonacci sequence, where in that case memoization actually saves time the first time the function is called (compared to a basic recursive approach without memoization). Just adding in case this helps anyone who was confused by that slide - feel free to comment if I’ve missed something."
10599,Simply amazing

10654,This may be the greatest CS video of all time
10655,I understand half of what you said. I&#39;m still learning.
10656,You want to get hired for a company? Fix their printer situation— 🤣 <br><br><br><br>This actually happened to me btw. Mind blowing how some people get things set up so poorly and then just live with it like there’s nothing that can be done. 🤦‍♂️
10657,Honestly one of the best tech videos out there.

10660,A nibble? Does he mean nipple??
10661,superior vid.
10662,Dijkstra is greedy because it selects the local optimal choice. An algorithm can both be greedy and always find the optimal solution.

10667,Excellent summary
10668,That&#39;s 4 years of computer Science degree in 13 minutes 🔥
10669,I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m more confused or less confused.<br><br>Just joking. This was a fantastic video!
10670,"It&#39;s 2022 we have AI, drones and computer vision but we cant have easy to use printers... I still have to debug printer issues at work"
10671,Kidding aside. On Android running your project again after it fails is very normal. This is due to caching and some Gradle stuff that will throw some issue out of nowhere.

10677,CS course in 100 seconds worth 4 year of Bachelor&#39;s
10678,I low key needed this video
10679,please post tutorials!
10680,Just the thing to watch when getting ready for interviews after a few years of writing production code.
10681,I learned 101 different topics from CS without even knowing I learned 101 different topics from CS
10682,If someone is new to computer science should I maybe not send this to them? Idk if it will be helpful or scary.
10683,perfectly encapsulated
10684,"@xFTOxGold I started when I was 23 after wasting (arguably) 5 years in university, you&#39;re way ahead of me already. :) Good luck mate."
10685,"@xFTOxGold It&#39;s alright, you&#39;ll get there, one step at a time. Don&#39;t try to skip over essentials that might make your life harder later on, and you&#39;ll be fine. A lot of self taught devs might brag about being able to land jobs after just 3 months but I&#39;d argue it&#39;s probably a full year for the average person before they&#39;re job ready (that was the case for me too), and could take longer or shorter depending on the efficiency of your learning and since we&#39;re self taught, efficiency is a huge factor and could even be a matter of luck (nobody can truly measure their own learning efficiency as they&#39;re learning)."
10686,"I can imagine how overwhelming this video would&#39;ve been for me if I watched it when I was a beginner, but this works very well for people who already have some experience in programming by summarizing and also including some concepts you may not have been aware of, but could understand easily if you spent some time learning about them."

10700,The &#39;=&#39; operator is not the equality operator. It is the assignment operator. &#39;==&#39;&#39; is the equality operator. You got that wrong.
10701,You don&#39;t need to know how anything works. There is thorough documentation that will tell how it works
10702,WOw this explanation is so cool. Amazing goof job!

10705,Can you tell us how you search and find the movie clips you throw in the videos?
10706,Lol! You just explained mine whole cpmputer science degree in one video.But only people who already learned these things can understand these videos because it is very fast and not very conceptual.<br>But it is really good for those who wants to review their course
10707,😧
10708,"r****d is a slur, if that&#39;s what&#39;s in your thumbnail please change it."
10709,Why is it that only people explaining stuff with a robot voice is the only information I pay attention to...It&#39;s weird if the video doesn&#39;t sound like a robot I won&#39;t pay attention at all. This video I&#39;m paying attention and learning. Good stuff.
10710,Ok but what is a monad and why is it just a monoid in the category of endofunctors
10711,I envy your expertise in this field of knowledge. Good job 👍
10712,I used to hate dial up modems in the 90s and early 2000s. Now it is the printer that causes me the most grief.
10713,you&#39;re channel is so underrated.  you deserve a side next to Daddy Gabe
10714,God what a great video. I’m going to share this with my parents so that they might be able to grasp what I do and stop asking me to fix their TVs every time I come to their house
10715,Thanks
10716,You&#39;re really good sir
10717,So basically my 5 years of studying (its 5 years in Colombia) was explained in 13 minutes... -_-*

Many thanks bro 😎 I was self taught for the most part and seeing the whole picture painted out is very consoling, knowing i wasn&#39;t just running in the bushes, as I&#39;d always compare myself to my peers pursuing a CS degree who had a much more direct content material. Many thanks you have helped me in ways you will never know."
10720,everything in P is okay as speed
10721,"i cant express with words how tankfull i am for this video, i am last year it student(who sucks at comps) and since i studied at home on my own i had the knowledge but it never clicked for me so to say, i knew stuff but not how those stuff are connected to each other, this video really helped, it was a summery of almost everything an it student will learn in debt(excludint the math, and believe me oh god is there a lot of math) and how its all connected to each other and for thos guys that study it even if the main thing we gotta know is how to code knowing those stuff is really important"

Depending of what sequence (what kind of hormone) CPU or computer as a whole accepted , it will reproduce different emotion (behaviour in general) ."
10727,Even after watching this 5 times I have no idea wtf is happening
10728,"Awesome, you literally summarized my 5 yeras of IT college ... and the last one is 🔥🔥"
10729,"Dude, you screwed up dynamic and static types so hard. It&#39;s not about telling the compiler, it&#39;s about the compiler knowing it. In Python, a variable&#39;s type can change at any point. In static typed languages, variables have fixed types, known at compile time."
10730,This is literally what we&#39;re being taught at my college🤣🤣<br>First year.
10731,Great 👍 Guess I won&#39;t be needing a CS degree now. Thanks for saving my money and time.

10737,This video basically summarized a year  of basic EE and intermediate CS at my university. Amazing video.
10738,"WHY DO ALL CS PPL TALK SO FAST, still good info but had to watch 5 times… wait a minute I think I have been fooled."
10739,I just forgot the reason why I went to University
10740,The first quarter of this video covers a whole year of cs
10741,Fireship well fricking done . Outstanding video man!<br>Nicely done!
10742,"That was amazing, just finished first year comp sci and am pleasantly suprised I understand basically all of this now"

10747,statically typed means you cant change the type of variable once it&#39;s declared. What you described is type inference

10761,All of us computer <b>engineering</b> major from ABET unis: we know how it works. we just don&#39;t know what kinda overly complicated abstraction the comp sci ppl pulled out of their circus hat
10762,"How the hell!? There&#39;s a clip from the movie &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot;?!"
10763,for legal reasons have to clarify it was a joke
10764,no way im gonna rob a bank this is too much to learn
10765,"Jokes on you, found this video myself"
10766,I’ve learned more here than I have of 3 yrs of a computer scientist teacher lol thx ☺️
10767,best video in 2022
10768,"my brain hurts, nice video though!"
10769,I burst to tears with the garbage collector 🤣

10771,Very informative
10772,"Very nice, thanks"
10773,"In my first year at CS, the instructor gave us three types of printers to study.<br>Seriously, what&#39;s the deal with printers?"
10774,"You are a gem, 4 years of university in 13 minutes."
10775,I&#39;m surprised there wasn&#39;t just 5 concepts
10776,I have taken 4-5 years of my life to understand this and you just done that in 13 mins. That is awesome.
10777,The video was crafted so well. Good job

10827,&quot;many languages are single-threaded&quot; but actually ONLY JS is single-threaded
10828,this is good for CS people but not well described at all for non-CS people. E.g. objects and classes use so many specific buzzwords that the non-CS person gets lost in a few seconds and never recovers
10829,“Most languages also have a string type”<br>Cries in C++ programming
10830,Just &quot;fixed&quot; a printer yesterday lol
10831,Are hashs also called objects ?

10833,Flashback of days in school and faces of those professors.
10834,"I&#39;m proud of myself for knowing most of these.<br><br>Tho I am a programmer, so I very well goddamn should."
10835,"Type inference has nothing to do with types being static or dynamic. Haskell s glorious type system is static, yet it can derrive the type of almost every variable automatically<br><br>Instead static typization is about checking the type of an argument you pass to a function in compile time, opposed to dynamic typisation, that checks that in runtime. Also I believe  that dynamic types allow you to change the type of a variable by assigning or casting it. This ability of a variable to change it&#39;s type is the reason such type system is called dynamic."

10841,Proud to say I knew all of the topics… except for 101 😓
10842,Currently teaching myself to code and this was so helpful for solidifying ideas and concepts. Thank you
10843,Amazing 100 concepts!
10844,thank you :)
10845,"Learned more in this video than all of my Information Technology class in high school, god Mr. Miller was awful"
10846,It&#39;s funny because actually understanding just the 100 concepts explained here would make you a decent and employable programmer.
10847,"i took APCS this year and have been doubting that I have the knowledge to begin game development, after watching this I feel smarter because I knew a lot of it (exept for the memory parts, i kinda get some of them but not really)"

10854,Is this like the &quot;map&quot;? Where I look up the details for myself?
10855,Man in 5 year of CS classes i never understood dynamic programming and you just explained it to me in literally 5 seconds
10856,"They say at the moment of your death, life flash before your eyes. Then this video makes years of lessons at the academy flashed at 13 minutes before your eyes."

10859,It was nice to watch and know all of these at least at a high level.
10860,Mfing printers
10861,horse
10862,yes
10863,"Just Idk if there is a fully compiled language that is actually dynamically typed. But in general these six terms aren&#39;t always divided between two categories, that are: compiled with explicit static types VS interpreted with inferred dynamic types, as that part of the video seemed to suggest."
10864,"Static types afaik can also be inferred, not just dynamically interpreted ones, and the latter may actually be explicitly defined by the programmer in some languages, is that right?"
10865,"That one jerk in the comments that says, &quot;A transistor isn&#39;t a switch. It&#39;s an amplifier.&quot;"

10869,I like turtles
10870,"@Yousef Ali A stack frame consists of 1. The parameters to the function, 2. Memory allocated to hold all stack variables the function needs, and 3. The return address of the function that called it. In non-tail recursion, each recursive call allocates a new frame, with new parameters,  new variable memory, and a new pointer that links back to the previous stack frame. But in tail recursion, the compiler optimizes it so each call just overwrites the previous parameters and variable allocations and reuses the return pointer, same as if you had just written a for-loop."
10871,If it overwrites the last call then how it returns from the call?
10872,"Nice summary! I would just add one more concept about recursion and the call stack at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=8m03s"">8:03</a> which is that some programming languages (mostly the functional ones) include something called tail recursion (or tail call optimization). Tail recursion doesn&#39;t keep pushing onto the call stack; instead it overwrites the last call on the stack with the recursive call, which can result in potentially infinite recursion with finite memory space."
10873,grandma&#39;s printer joke was OP
10874,Clear and concise with plenty of prompts for further research. Keep it up!
10875,lmfao! this printer thing is so damn true XD
10876,"Ah yes, me programmer now."
10877,Hey Man! how bout AI 101??!
10878,Outstanding content. One of the best channels on YouTube.
10879,am I tripping? are the big endian and little endian pictures the same? is this a joke?
10880,The mf printer part 🤣🤣🤣
10881,Great video. But the last one and the expression used to describe it was bang on :)
10882,Damn here we go again..
10883,"That must have been terribly difficult to write and develop, to clearly and cleanly describe and define all that in 13 minutes. Bravo.<br><br>I studied this stuff over the course of about ten years, though not exclusively. I never got a CS degree, I went to college instead, but yeah, this is pretty much &#39;the basics&#39;. You even threw the Design Patterns book in there. After this stuff, the rest is practice."
10884,"Wow, it was really good. Looking forward for more of these!"
10885,Now I have a CS degree
10886,goddamn motherfucking printers man.....
10887,&quot;Explained?&quot; What does that even mean anymore?
10888,Video idea: bootstrap in 100 min
10889,This is EXACTLY what I needed. Precisely what I needed. Thanks!!!!
10890,👍🤓👍
10891,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m10s"">12:10</a> nice IP address there 👍"
10892,Perfect video for former graduates that want to quickly recall alot of their batchelor&#39;s degree basics that they have forgotten due to not being needed anymore.
10893,4 years in 13 minutes. That&#39;s some incredible power of synthesis.
10894,This is my favorite video of the year.
10895,"Fortnite battlepass, I just shit out my ass."
10896,you mentioned linux first so I&#39;m giving this a thumbs up &lt;3
10897,"it wouldn&#39;t be accurate to state that you need a CS degree, there&#39;s tons of people getting hired at google doing insane stuff that even this video wouldn&#39;t be able to explain in simple terms that never went to college, most and not all of them are self taught, and besides, literally more than half of the concepts explained here would be available in a programming course. Don&#39;t get into unnecessary debt for something that&#39;s more accessible than pornography."
10898,I need to lie down now.
10899,My technical career started with mother f’n printers lol. The amount of good karma you have earned with this vid is immeasurable.
10900,"Awesome, you have done the thing in which i had taken 3years(graduation) to learn all those concepts."
10901,That was brilliant 😮
10902,Am I missing something or did you accidentally use the same image for both big endian and little endian?
10903,the flow of the video damnnn chefs kiss
10904,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m18s"">5:18</a><br><br>&quot;The most useful data structure is the array&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;cries in hash&quot;."
10905,"very well done. this is a good dose of crash the heck course for anyone interested in cs. I have a request, could you please make a video on quantum computing. since many of us sinful souls are from the logical binary world of 1s and 0s, we are not &quot;intelligent enough&quot; to understand the &quot;quantum computing&quot;. Personally I have a sincere doubt that its a super snake oil."
10906,"I graduate next month and didn&#39;t believe that I actually know 100 CS concepts. yeah except the last, fk grandma&#39;s printer"
10907,One also needs to learn how to set up wifi real quick for &#39;grandma&#39; too...
10908,"Thanks Fireship, after all of these concepts I finally know how to fix my printer"
10909,"Lol, you&#39;re funny bstrd.  Keep up the great work!"
10910,"True, I made my first AI project in python in a week, without knowing what I really did.."
10911,"Where did you get that meme, where the ram gets shot by the garbage collector?"
10912,Please stop using the r-word :(
10913,"DNS is Domain Name System (not Service). While you didn&#39;t explicitly said that this is what the abbreviation stands for, what you said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m16s"">12:16</a> could mislead many into thinking that DNS is Domain Name Service."

10925,Fireship always nails his intros 😂😂😂
10926,did you break to drink water while recording this?
10927,Why am I watching this? I just graduated
10928,Dude your videos just keep getting better and better.
10929,Thanks so much for this. Really love your contents.
10930,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a> my understanding of &quot;short circuit evaluation&quot; is that the expression (False and exit()) evaluates to False immediately instead of calling exit()."
10931,100+ way Fireship hurt your feelings
10932,"Thank you very much jeff, I have been a landscaper for the last ten years, for 6 months I watch at least one of your videos a day, thanks to you tomorrow I have my first interview as a software engineer"

10940,This is brilliantly done
10941,23. &quot;Without any extra dependencies&quot; -&gt; What are dependencies?

10944,I am a Computer Scientist now 😎
10945,"I wish I watched this video yesterday when they asked me about algorithms and recursion in an interview. This is pure gold, you&#39;re the best!"
10946,you lost me in the third half of the video
10947,This video is absolutely EPIC
10948,The Endian in the Cupboard
10949,That&#39;s some dope ass content!
10950,So basically it revised almost every lecture of my CS degree 🙃
10951,"Every developer should watch this over a hundred times over, will supercharge your dev career"
10952,Not just CS majors but IS majors too lol that was a ton of useful info!
10953,Dude that was awesome. The way you connected all the terms...Every CS student should make a chart out of this video in my opinion. Thank you
10954,The man just explained my 3 years of college in 13 minute
10955,That was amazing
10956,"The images @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a> for the concept of &quot;endianness&quot; are ambiguous. Otherwise awesome video, thanks!"
10957,"Wow! This is just an Awesome, Awesome video.  Just flowed together starting with hardware. Bravo! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿"
10958,That&#39;s literally 4 years of college
10959,"Забавно, когда это все в школе рассказывают"
10960,&quot;Turning Machine&quot; Ight ima head out
10961,That was the most amazing vid i saw this month
10962,Now I request your 100 seconds dedicated on Printer.
10963,YOU ARE MY CODING SENSEI!
10964,you&#39;ve just briefed my 5 years degree :)
10965,This was amazing
10966,Shittiest video of fireship ever
10967,"I have been learning about programming and CS from 2020 on my own and it feels really good that I already knew almost all the concepts mentioned here, barring Little Endian and Big Endian."
10968,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=05m07s"">05:07</a> Little Endian graphic is incorrect. (should be in reverse order, instead of a Big Endian duplicate)"
10969,Omfg I needed this three years ago. This is so awesome. Wow
10970,"Actually, pilots learn about aerodynamics in flight school."
10971,"Printers rely on highly sophisticated AI models to predict when you&#39;re gonna need them the most, so they can run out of ink and halt mid process (to mess up your print and get a sheet of paper stuck in there). Cutting edge tech, really."
10972,WOW. gold.
10973,wow. thank you!! i love videos like these so much.
10974,I would like to have had a video like this when a I started studying CS. All would have been so different
10975,That was so great! 😁👍
10976,As you said that you&#39;re going to present 101 CS concepts I thought you will prank everyone and present only five whilst explaining the binary system.<br>I&#39;m happy you didn&#39;t and presented a bunch of comcepts and mainly a good large scale overview.
10977,Thanks! This deserves a super like!
10978,This video helped me install windows
10979,This is 1st sem of cs engineering syllabus crammed into a 15 mins video. Great job. Heard of the term Nibble after a long time!
10980,It was nice to see a channel to get 1m sub. When i started to watch it was around 60/70k
10981,asd
10982,Smart dumb finger counting using multiple peoples hands should use base eleven because 10 and 0 fingers could be up
10983,"&quot;Over 100 concepts are explained&quot; hahaha. I mean, you&#39;re not wrong"
10984,tfw big and little endian use the exact same picture
10985,"Yes. This video summed up what half of I&#39;ve learned in the last 4 years in the Computer Science course at my University. I thought I would do more programming though, but they just explained the essentials, you will have to learn most of it on your own."
10986,GIVE ME BOOK TITLE.. THIS IS THE THING I NEED THE MOST! <br>B O O K T I T L E S P L E A S E ! <br>need&#39;m want&#39;m got to have&#39;m <br>Book titles NAME THAT BOOK<br>Surrender your library reading list to us we are the BORG ! Mmmmrrr😤
10987,i felt like i kept up with most of this until printers were mentioned. Then I was suddenly on lunch break
10988,System for measuring the efficiency of algorithms is  asymptotic notations. Big-Oh notation is just one type the asymptotic notations.
10989,These are the most uncontrolled yet smooth transitions I have ever watched lol.
10990,You Forgot the two most important topics: How to fix Wifi &amp; Fix my phone.<br>You are not a Computer Engineer if you can&#39;t fix this.🥲
10991,I just got it! How about Al Gore playing drums === algorithm
10992,Imagine this guy is our university teacher .
10993,You really make amazing content.. Hats-off !
10994,This video is so good!
10995,"Great video, except the server having a 456 in the first octet of a ipv4 address triggered me a little."
10996,My guy just summarized the whole 4 years of my cs degree in just 13 mins. You&#39;re a genius!
10997,Python is dynamically typed<br>Hold my cython compiler!
10998,This is gold
10999,"From transistors through kernels under the cloud and APIs, these are the ABCs of computer science"

11008,"You know, I&#39;m currently doing my Master Degree in Computer Science and sometimes I think: I haven&#39;t learned anything during all that time.<br>Videos like that one show, how much stuff I see as self-evident in the meantime and furthermore how much besides of these basics I got to know during University.<br>If you&#39;re thinking about studing it, do it man! It&#39;s one of the coolest and mentally demanding things you can do and the best thing: I&#39;ve heard and seen a lot of arrogant and overbearing people in other courses (especially in law and business administration) - in computer sciene it feels like most of the people are waaay more relaxed, really want to help you and it often feels more like a big family of nerds helping each other out (Stack Overflow - I love you) to fix problems without all of that pointless &quot;I am better than you&quot; - mindset."
11009,This video is literally everything my CS degree taught me.
11010,You forgot Data Oriented Programming
11011,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=1m21s"">1:21</a> We actually use unary when counting on our hands, not Base-10. Sure, we can count <i>to</i> 10, but the base of the number system is determined by how many unique digits there are in it, and when we count on our hands, that&#39;s only 1, since the only state of a finger that we care about is when it&#39;s lifted.<br>Interestingly, we can also count binary on our fingers (by looking at two states of a finger- up and down), so we can count to 1023 using just two hands alone, but be prepared to make certain insulting hand gestures on the way.<br>Amazing video, by the way!"
11012,The garbage day  scene was hilarious 😂
11013,Hey! Uncool! I&#39;ve been paying a lot of money to get this free knowledge for the last two years! 🥺
11014,the most important thing to know as a sde is how to talk shit in team meetings lol
11015,that&#39;s absolutely one of the best video&#39;s i ever watched in my entire life !!!!
11016,I knew 97/101 topics. Nice
11017,You got one of the most deserved likes
11018,"Just finished my CS undergrad, printers are magic - it was in the course material.."
11019,Implying that a programmer should know anything about electronics is like implying that every car driver has to be an expert in metalurgy.
11020,My entire cs degree summed up in 13.07 minutes 🙁
11021,"You have hurted my Software Engineering feelings, i am not watching this video now."
11022,I hear Haskell I click like
11023,The flow of the terms and connection is amazing.
11024,spoken like a true year 3 dropout :)
11025,This is the best video I&#39;ve seen in the entire galaxy. The amount of information in such a small time is just amazing. <br><br>I would love to watch another video like this Jeff!!
11026,"after i finished watching this video, my focus is gone..."
11027,"Hold on! What if this guy had taught me for whole 4 years of my engineering.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>😵‍💫"
11028,Shivering at that cstring declaration
11029,I think you hurt a lot of computer science majors in here thinking they’ll use their operating systems class at a professional job. Unless they’re working with embedded systems I suppose…
11030,bro just went over my comp sci 240 course in the first 3 min
11031,Woo too much knowledge 🙂
11032,Why did it take me so long to realize that the “signed” part of a signed integer means that it LITERALLY USES A FUCKING SIGN
11033,You know the educational system has failed you when a 10 minute Fireship video summarises 1/3 of your Computer Science A-Level curriculum.
11034,Thanks for the nightmares that this video will bring back from my CS classes.... NotLikeThis
11035,Perfect!
11036,Wow. Just wow!
11037,Amazing.
11038,omg!!! you should make a much bigger version of this NOW..
11039,"Whats the first thing you should do when your code throws an error? &quot;rm -f -r /project, unplug your PC and throw it out the bloody window&quot;"
11040,"Wait, pilots don’t know anything about aerodynamics?  You mean all this time we we’re just lucky that pilots don’t fly slower than the stall speed and fall out of the sky?"
11041,The pacing is a little too fast but other than that great video
11042,"Amazing job Jeff, this video can be a resource for the next 10 years. You created a new way to explain dev things"
11043,Dude slooowwww the fuck downn<br>My brain can’t keep up
11044,"That was astonishingly well written, edited and generally put together. Thank you for the work you put in, Jeff. That was a trip."
11045,01000001
11046,I knew most stuff but still watched the entire video.
11047,I failed out of CS due to printers 🖨
11048,"You forgot to mention the most important concept that most CS students will have to live with until they are about 30 years old, that would be... virginity."
11049,"Nice video, If I happened to understand most of that then do you think it would be easy for me to get a degree in CS?"
11050,Wow super awesome... Now everything very clear 👏👏👏👏👍🏽😘
11051,Excited for that members only course on fax machine troubleshooting
11052,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=6m20s"">6:20</a> that&#39;s a binary search tree. Very useful to find information very quickly, and a nice detail to this video"

11054,"as a self taught programmer, i&#39;m proud to say i understand 70% of this IT lingo😀"
11055,No word about logical programming languages like Prolog though

11057,Thanks for the knowledge...
11058,"man, this was soooo goood"
11059,it litteraly gone throught at least 85%cof my CS degree modules and it gave all the &quot;why&quot; which is the most important thing out there ! <br>Thank you again for that awesome video !!!

11063,"Ah yes, me here still learning who formed abacus to who made univac. I hope I can fix some bugs after I learn those.<br><br><br>I am a computer science student"
11064,"Great video. <br>Though point 43 isn&#39;t correct. A Hash function creates is a semi-unique id (hash), it is not an synonym for map. <br>The most common implementations of Maps and Dictionaries use Hashes to improve performance, as comparing a simple hash string is easier then comparing entire objects. Only comparing the entire objects for values whose hash matches the hash of the given key.<br>There are however maps that do not uses hashes, which can be useful when the key is mutable, which would cause the hash at insertion to be different than the hash when the key is used to get the matching value."
11065,Make another like this ❤️❤️
11066,"Dequeue can both mean a verb “to remove from the queue”, as well a shorthand for “double-ended queue”, also spelled deque, which is both a queue and a stack."
11067,"There’s a slight mixup regarding static and dynamic languages: in a dynamic language you can actually change the type of a variable mid program.<br>This distinction is relevant for example in scala which is statically typed, but you don’t always have to declare types since it can infer the type from the provided value."
11068,"A list is not rly the same as an array, is it..? An array usually has fixed size and same data type for every element, but a list is a more abstract concept, no?"

11091,"Wow, I feel like I waste a lot of time at University trying to figure out the whole picture. This video is a true gem and must be seen by anyone interested in CS."
11092,I just revised 80% of my 3 years in computer science studies
11093,"before clicking this video i thought maybe there are some stuff i dont know but now i realised i already know all of this.

11096,As someone who has been in the IT sphere for 15 years I can say with confidence that concept 101 is impossible.
11097,Where can I learn computer science? What website do you recommend? What school do you recommend.
11098,Man litteraly summed up 3-5years of univeristy courses in 13 minutes.
11099,"@Fireship, the graphics for big endian and little endian are exactly the same"
11100,"As always, simply amazing. Both YouTube and website."
11101,You can&#39;t just tell me I need to know about printers without giving me some helpful advice!!!!!🙃
11102,"I cannot even imagine how long it would take to make a quality video like this! Bravo Jeff, and thank you."
11103,LEGEND
11104,"when I was at school using unity, we frequently use coroutine to do dumb thing like a delay, without knowing what a coroutine is. I still don&#39;t really understand what coroutine is, other than it can kinda just remember to do something later while the code handle other stuff."

11118,"One small note on #88 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m20s"">12:20</a>... It sounds like you are describing simultaneous multithreading which is not strictly necessary to enable threads in the operating system. A lot of implementations of multithreading just use regular time-based scheduling in the operating system."

11131,You are so right. I know because my advisor is able to find so many good plays. My  portfolio literally went from $300k to $1.1m last year (not counting withdrawals I made) all really exciting. I guess it’s the experience and better judgement.

11175,I woke up and opened my phone to hit the like button the moment I remembered I didn&#39;t hit it
11176,Now I know how my garbage code actaully works. Thanks!
11177,"Wow, this guy is really just spitting out a bunch of buzz words and tacking on a poor low quality explanation. Pathetic."
11178,"Thanks, this is very insightful. Only people with years of experience will truly appreciate the art of summing up these whole concepts as one unified meaningful piece of information."
11179,Im wrapping up my second semester as a CSE major and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I&#39;ve already learned a huge chunk of these concepts. I really love this field so far and I can&#39;t wait to learn more!

11181,Fix the printers.
11182,i&#39;m somewhat of a computer scientist myself
11183,I get my degree next week and this was actually great at recapping what I have learned
11184,My 4 year Computer Science explained in 13 mins.
11185,"This is pure gold. Straight to my reference watchlist. Thank you so much for your videos. Taking the time and effort to condensate so much knowledge into a couple of minutes. You may not go deeply into topics but these videos serve as a quick refresh for those who know, and as a starting guide for those who don&#39;t. It&#39;s really helpful for both cases and that&#39;s something I had never seen before on YouTube so keep it up, I really hope the best for your channel mate"

Generally they know a lot of the stuff you sum up already , but it’s super hard to find sum up that are that good , reliable and quick on the Internet. And when they don’t know one subject each of your video « in 100seconds » is THE best and fastest way to get started on that subject and it saves hours of work for us.<br>I can’t imagine the amount of work you have put on your videos and for that (and the quality of your videos) I can’t thank you hard enough."

11200,tha fact that at the end this entire video feels like the setup for the joke...
11201,Why did I even go to university.
11202,"Ha! The first thing I do when I hit an error is run it again. It only works about half the time, though."

11219,Weird flex but ok man ;)
11220,I start my first day as a Software Developer tomorrow and looking at the concepts was refreshing and made me feel ready. I liked the explanations of each of the concepts because even someone with no prior knowledge can have an idea of what you are talking about. Great teacher 👍
11221,hi mom!
11222,"Holy Cow, how could i forget about printers NotLikeThis"

11247,I am going to put ‘FireShip’ on the education section of my resume.
11248,goddamnit. my code doesnt work. gotta get a new degree now
11249,Why did you place the most important CS concept last in the video?
11250,There&#39;s one more &quot;encapsulate&quot; just before #81
11251,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
11252,"Actually, you fumbled this out of the gate. If your code fails, you should immediately collect the crash log and as much state as possible.<br><br>If you &quot;obviously change nothing and try to run it again a few times&quot; hoping for it to work and it does, you might have just thrown away valuable data for a bug that is hard to reproduce. Having a bug that is hard to reproduce manifest is a blessing, so store all the data you can from the runtime when it happens."

11255,I&#39;m in awe. I&#39;m sharing this with absolutely everyone.
11256,This broke down all the studying I have done for the last 5 years in a 13 minute video. Well done man.
11257,Wow compact and to the point video filled with useful info that any software developer worth his salt will <b>want to know</b> <b>and needs to know</b> . Good stuff and its exactly why I subscribed.
11258,you are the MVP
11259,"dang, 4 years of university summarized in 13mins and I honestly got more out of this than university. When saw printers on the syllabus, I dropped out."
11260,He left the best(and most important) for last
11261,Dude you just summarised like two years of my college materials + a few more things I&#39;ve never heard of !<br>Awesome!
11262,It&#39;s like a compressed form of the first 2 semesters of a CS bachelors degree. Very well done. I wonder though if you could show this to someone who was never in contact with CS stuff and make that person understand what CS is.
11263,Masterpiece  🤓
11264,Damn man! Awesome! Super LIKE
11265,HOLY! SLOW DOWN DUDE XD

11270,Do you want to make a video about ansible? I figuered since you did one about terraform it might be a cool idea to explore that one too. Love the vids!
11271,I wish sometime in future you&#39;ll do a zoomed in version of these so I can finally explain to my family members that I didn&#39;t join a cult.
11272,So I used memoization without knowing it
11273,"i will forever love your content. even if it&#39;s a topic i doubt i&#39;ll ever use, i absolutely love watching these."

11282,the kind of video i was searching since long
11283,"Great job condensing a lot of topics into a very short video. However, understandably a couple mistakes managed to sneak in:<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m45s"">3:45</a> is incorrect. Statically typed means that the compiler knows the type before the code is executed; however that does NOT mean that you need to specify the type in your code. Most statically typed languages can figure all or most of the types out on their own. Theoretically a dynamically typed language could also require explicit typing, although I&#39;m not aware of a language like that.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m47s"">12:47</a> is also wrong/misleading. REST as an architectural pattern has more to do with the way information is exchanged between a client and a server rather than URLs mapping to resources, the main point being that it doesn&#39;t require a connection to keep track of the state."

11291,How many concepts you already know?
11292,XD final tip
11293,4 years doing a computer science degree and now you&#39;re telling me I could&#39;ve just watched this 13 minute video!
11294,CSS = computer science science
11295,You have 0 job alerts.😂
11296,I love the way you begin from the absolute first knowledge and then evolve... great video
11297,Now I&#39;m going to ask for a refund at my university since they let me spend 3 years on CS instead of 13 minutes. Having a bootcamp + this video is kickstart your career.

11303,Computer science in a nutshell.
11304,"It&#39;s just amazing to think that it all comes down to just 0 and 1, on or off."
11305,Someone knowledgeable should post a reaction video of this and point out the funny mistakes in the samples.
11306,the last one is the most useful concept
11307,"Haha, summed up my life in 13 minutes! Especially that last one, it hit haaaard."
11308,This video is GOLD!!
11309,wow you just summarized my first year of my cs course in my college
11310,Did I just waste four years studying?

11314,There are only two types of Indians - big and small
11315,"Most of these exist in IT courses as well, such as OS, networking, memory etc.. so it&#39;s not so bad. The math parts are the real treat, with not much coding involved. Computability which involves linguistic concepts related to ability to compute problems aren&#39;t even mentioned, which started with Turing machine, expanding out to automate, regular language and all of that. That&#39;s not the point in the end. Computer science is just math course related to computers, kind of like music theory vs performance. Sure, you should know the music theory as a musician, but you can perform quite well without remembering all of the music theory concepts, because it&#39;s an entire different muscle."
11316,&gt; &quot;A pointer is a variable who&#39;s value is the memory address of another variable&quot;.<br><br>Teachers at university could have just said that and saved us a lot of time and headaches.
11317,Can we actually get a 100s video on how printers work?
11318,Dude yes. Right down to the last moment of the video where you mention printers. It&#39;s so perfect. DUDE YOUR VIDEOS GIVE ME JOY.
11319,Awesome video! Nitpick: Little endian is reversed.
11320,I love this channel
11321,This video made me want to become a software engineer even more
11322,wow… must have been a lot of work to put it together. 👏🏻👏🏻
11323,"I thought the 101st concept was going to be &quot;Bug&quot;, but the Printer problem can also be counted as a bug, so it&#39;s fine, I guess?"

11366,More precise? We have an average of 1 concept per 8 seconds over here. I don&#39;t believe that your wording would make any difference to the intended viewer.
11367,"Strong/weak typing, dynamic/static typing and explicit/inferred typing have got to be THE most massively misunderstood concepts in the entirety of computer science. So much incorrect information that&#39;s confidently regurgitated around, even by popular trusted sources."
11368,"26 — “figures out the type automatically” can also refer to type inference, which is not the same as dynamic typing. Something along the lines of “figures out the type of a variable when it is used” would be more precise."

11420,"Here comes my personal list of annoying nitpicking<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a> transistors - bits. Although you didn&#39;t say anything exactly wrong, the image shows transistors as being switches that maintain whatever state they&#39;re at. Transistors are more like push buttons that connect the two ends <i>while</i> you are &quot;pressing&quot; them, the analog for pressing in the case of transistors is actually just energizing them via a third &quot;cable&quot;. Also, the concept of bit is not tied to transistors.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=1m05s"">1:05</a> byte. Technically a byte doesn&#39;t have to be 8 bits, and there actually are platforms where they are not 8 bits, a group of 8 bits is called an octet. This is just me being pedantic, most of the time this distinction is useless.<br><br><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=1m19s"">1:19</a> binary. The explanation for binary is great, and this is where the definition of bit actually comes from, a bit is just a *bi*nary digi*t*.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m11s"">3:11</a> executable. Although you can make binaries that don&#39;t have external dependencies, most of the time you&#39;ll deal with regular <i>dinamically linked</i> binaries, that need the kernel to load dynamic libraries before they are able to run. Usually on linux a binary will be linked to at least libc and on windows to kernel32.dll.<br>By the way, although on windows there is no distinction between a binary and an executable, on linux anything that the kernel can execute is called an executable, this includes scripts with a shebang right at the start and the executable permission set, like python scripts if you set them up correctly.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> dynamically typed. That is not the definition of dynamically typed, that is the definition of type inference, which is a feature associated with statically typed languages (though languages with gradual typing like TypeScript might have type inference while still being dynamic). Dynamically typed languages are the ones that store type information alongside each value so that they don&#39;t have to figure the types out before runtime.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m44s"">3:44</a> statically typed. Statically typed just means that all the types are known at compile/build time. You don&#39;t necessarily have to explicitly write the type down on the code. There are statically typed languages with great type inference capabilities like C++, Go, Rust, Haskell, among others. Where you can optionally omit the types.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m25s"">5:25</a> array. &quot;Maintains&quot; a list of indices sounds like it stores them. The indices are usually just implied by the layout of the array elements in memory. Though, languages¹ that use associative arrays² to implement regular arrays do store the indices³.<br>¹ Like JS, PHP and Lua<br>² a.k.a. maps, dictionaries, tables, hashes, etc<br>³ Except when they don&#39;t, JS engines are really cool and sometimes optimize JS arrays as C-style arrays<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a> map. From the phrasing, it sounds like maps store the information in a linear way, they don&#39;t¹.<br>¹ Except when they do, in some cases implementing a map as a vector of pairs is more efficient because of space restrictions or cache locality (for example eastl::vector_map in C++). But usually they don&#39;t.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a> algorithim. Typo on algorithm.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=7m36s"">7:36</a> conditional logic. &quot;Short-circuit&quot; is not applicable to this context. Short-circuiting is when a part of an expression&#39;s evaluation is omitted, usually seen with the ternary operator.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=11m28s"">11:28</a> parallelism. Here there is an equivocation between kernel threads and processor threads. Kernel threads are abstractions for different tasks that are executing concurrently and possibly in parallel, in linux a thread is almost the same as a process, except multiple threads from the same process can share memory, whereas memory between different processes is isolated (for stability as well as security reasons).<br>A processor thread, as you explained, is kind of a virtual processor core.<br>Kernel threads and processes are scheduled to run on physical threads by the kernel, and you can have 100s of kernel threads that are created and destroyed all the time, while the physical threads are fixed by whatever hardware you have.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m12s"">12:12</a> ip address - url. IP addresses are aliased by domain names, and those are the ones stored in DNS. Universal Resource Locators (aka URLs) locate resources, and in order to do that they include a host section, that can be the domain name, or the ip address. In addition to that, the URL has more sections to be able to accurately locate the resource, like the protocol, the path, optionally the port, optional credentials, etc.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m28s"">12:28</a> ssl. SSL is deprecated, nowadays we use TLS.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m41s"">12:41</a> api. APIs (even in the sense of the term that is used here) are not associated with &quot;modern&quot; servers, they have been around since forever. For the general definition of the term API, you could say that APIs have existed since before OS themselves, but that is just being pedantic.<br><br>I&#39;m just being nitpicky here, all of the content in the video is really useful.

11502,saying a shell wraps the kernel is a bit too short. a shell gives you the ability to execute binaries (and also do logic stuff and so on) which interact with other programs or the kernel
11503,THANK YOU<br><br>I NEEDED THIS FOR APCS
11504,I always fix my old printer by throwing a considerable amount of money buying a new one
11505,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m45s"">3:45</a> i don&#39;t think you could do this in C (assigning direct string to a variable) you&#39;ll need to use a loop or smth"
11506,wow impressive
11507,Wait.  I&#39;m plugging in my cassette drive...
11508,"...and now, we&#39;ll never know how to fix a printer... :/"
11509,How much time took you to do this video? Seems like a huge amount of effort
11510,Good video for the appropriate r/programmerhumor user
11511,"I feel much better now that I realized I know 99% of the concepts. That 1% I don&#39;t know is printers, AKA the spawn of satan in the computer world"
11512,You’ve lost all respect in my JavaScript community for using Python for examples instead of JavaScript. It’s over!
11513,"The little endian figure is the same as the big endian, it should be <br>0x100 0x101 0x102 0x103<br>[ 67 ]  [ 45 ]  [ 23 ]  [ 01 ]<br><br>Great video nonetheless! ♥️♥️"
11514,Your videos are so amazing 🤩
11515,Please do another one with 1000+ concepts
11516,I was so happy until last second of video when I realised that I know entire CS but still couldn’t fix my Printer 🖨
11517,Hey bro slow down I can’t write this fast
11518,What a great video every second was entertaining didn’t loose my interest at all. I’m looking forward to more videos this length
11519,Same keyboard as mine!
11520,who needs college when you have Fireship
11521,"Bro, thank you."
11522,yes
11523,What? Computer science without lambda?
11524,Amazing just Amazing
11525,(fattest c++ book in store + google) * 2 years of frustration and learning = some funny little SFML-2D-Platformers<br>(lunch break - this video ) / stuff on smartphone = na..
11526,Legend.
11527,EXCELLENT!! MY 2 Year experience in one clip
11528,Pure gold
11529,This video taught me more than my CS teacher in school ever could. Thanks for the amazing content man!
11530,Horse = triangle confirmed
11531,*hexadecimal
11532,My main concern is that for so long I thought that a CS degree is a C# degree
11533,I think databases were missing...
11534,This videos is bad ass! :)
11535,Looks like Jeff recently visited his grandma&#39;s house
11536,The last key concept was golden &quot;Mother F printers&quot;
11537,Thumbs up for this speed run. It was darn impressive :-)
11538,Legend!
11539,101 - so true !
11540,These just keep getting better and better. How can you be so skilled at both CS and and making vids
11541,Fire.
11542,100% accurate when he was talking about the printer ! Well done sir!
11543,Neat quick overview or re-hash of the whole CS-thing. As a noobie coder... you&#39;re accelerated my knowledge quite a bit.
11544,I have watched it 3 times and I am still learning more every time I go back through 😂 amazing video!
11545,The most important concept of computer science and one that you have missed is software freedom
11546,This dude on another level of education .
11547,"Before I found this video, the only work I could find was as a part-time banana peeler. Now, I&#39;ve learned everything I need to know to become a web developer. Thanks, Fireship!"
11548,Could you do JSON Schema in 100s? I’d love to document my json files but cant seem to understand it
11549,"your c example  at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m47s"">3:47</a> is wrong.. use &quot; for strings..<br>anyway thanks a lot for your high-quality content!"
11550,"this guy in the thumbnail , priceless !!"
11551,"Well hey, I already have a decent understanding of every topic you explain. Guess my Cs Degree actually taught me something haha"
11552,and IP address can&#39;t have &quot;456&quot; as one of its components
11553,We need more CS based content 🔥🔥
11554,Just took my AP Computer Science A exam today. Couldn&#39;t have more perfect timing.
11555,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m55s"">12:55</a> this hurt in so many ways my friend"
11556,"Very very great, but I was waiting for web 3.0 things in the end but..."
11557,Thanks!
11558,"A lot of these arent really cs concepts. The vast majority is basic programming. Cs is a lot more than that. Its engineering, computers, representations, systems, data, engineering, methodologies, computatibility and complexity, relational mapping and so on, and so on."
11559,Dude.... i Love u!!!
11560,This was my entire CS 219 course in 13 minutes...
11561,I knew about all the concepts shown in the video but my code is still garbage 🥲
11562,What&#39;s really wild is that the printer by my grandmas is actually broken 😩<br><br>It&#39;s also pretty rad how Jeff pretty much took us through the ABCs of computers. Probably the best primer I&#39;ve ever come across
11563,"This is really great, perhaps consider other videos along this line for certain categories like machine learning or data science or game production or cyber security &amp; cryptography."
11564,"oh man, printers! working as a network engineer, they were the bane of my existence for 2,5 years"
11565,Could we get a &quot;how to printer&quot; in 100seconds tutorial please
11566,"But Turing Machines can&#39;t compute anything, that is a core idea in computability theory and why we essentially cannot make anything in software (like the halting problem)."
11567,5 years in 13 minutes
11568,"As self-punishment, you should make a “Printer Networking in 100 seconds” video."
11569,🤣
11570,@Para Boo what is incorrect about the first fact
11571,@Para Boo He&#39;s calling an array a list. Hmmm...that&#39;s wrong.
11572,Hows the job search going btw? Did u get one? I&#39;m asking cuz I&#39;m in my 2nd year of cs
11573,I love counterstrike too how do i get a degree?
11574,"As someone who just graduated with a CS degree, I can confidently say that you successfully condensed 4 years of my life into 13 minutes. Well done!"
11575,Code report Pyscript incoming?
11576,Wow in just a half hour you have helped a lot of people.
11577,The ending was just unexpected to say the least!
11578,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=8m21s"">8:21</a> In languages with tail-call optimization you don&#39;t get a stack overflow for tail recursion."
11579,bro how long did this take you to make? Impressive condensed knowledge
11580,"Haha 5 ECTS in 13 minutes, nice one :D"
11581,youre amazing. i just learned what a garbage collector was and how its used in like 2 and a half seconds.
11582,Wait some coders dont know this huh
11583,98. SSL is dead. TLS instead of it
11584,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m09s"">5:09</a> image is the same"
11585,Amazing video
11586,galiba
11587,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m54s"">5:54</a> türkiye"
11588,"if you can fix printers, you pretty much have a job guaranteed"
11589,Fuck printer.
11590,Mate amazing video
11591,"Your analogies are depressing, plane crashing, gun shooting, breadlines... Otherwise, great video :)"
11592,"Yeah..though seeing what the concept Array is, isn&#39;t the same as working through multiple exercises about arrays with all their syntax errors, Arrayoutofbounds exceptions etc.<br>The illusion of learning is a sweet trap."
11593,My entire CS degree just flashed in those 13 minutes. Amazing work!
11594,Printers? Just install a Linux VM or boot Linux from USB and let it handle it.
11595,"Get a degree in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=13m07s"">13:07</a>! 😆This covers everything."
11596,@randomgeocacher tls is commonly referred to as ssl.
11597,@Philippe Baillargeon People use SSL interchangeably with TLS. Or they say SSL/TLS.
11598,"also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m12s"">12:12</a> domain name is a part of URL not alias to one"
11599,"@randomgeocacher To be fair SSL was more of an inacurracy than an error, since it was the protocol used before TLS and basically is the same thing. They just changed the name when the Internet Engineering Taskforce decided to improve the protocol. But technically speaking you are right."
11600,Going from OOP to Inheritance to the the gang of 4 book is another.  Design patterns prefer composition over inheritance.
11601,"Great video !<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m22s"">12:22</a> The server IP address, is not valid. An IP address (v4) is composed of 4 parts of 8 bits, so the biggest decimal number is 255."
11602,This is what I learned in the first two years in computer science. gg
11603,He forgot to include Data science and AI
11604,You are a God and this Video is a God blessing.
11605,Banger video. Shockingly thorough and a fantastic intro to computers.
11606,Now I realize that my computer science years were not in vain
11607,I feel like you could do an entire history of the world in 1 hour.  😂. Love the videos.  Your short videos are my favorite way to figure out a simple “wtf is this?”.
11608,Mtf printers
11609,420th comment
11610,You just taught me stuff in 13 min which took my teacher 6 months...Amazing Bro keep it up.
11611,💥💥💥💥
11612,Wow you just summarized 3 years of university
11613,Damn it was the best memory jog of all the things I have learned in the past. Fells like new again<br>⭐
11614,Simply put..... You are amazing !!!!
11615,The sad truth of 101 hurts
11616,where are the chapters
11617,My man squeezed my 4 years CSE degree into 13 mins..... kudos to you sir.
11618,best video ive watched this week 👏👏👏
11619,&quot;I know Kung Fu&quot;
11620,Also &quot;PC Load Error&quot; on printers. Still don&#39;t know what it means 🤯
11621,Another Banger 🔥🔥🔥
11622,"great video, but even before starting computer science I learned 90% of this concepts in highschool .-."
11623,how do you type statement at a time
11624,wrong! what you should do when your code throws an error is change multiple things at once and then run again
11625,おはようございます
11626,"Wow. So, I had been a fully educated computer scientist all along... Thanks Jeff! You actually make me grow as a person"
11627,Phenomenal!
11628,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a> What is the difference between the Big endian and Little endian pics?"
11629,Start of video is amazing
11630,Mother loving grandmas man...
11631,"Hey Jeff, could you please do Nim in 100 seconds?"
11632,those damn printers
11633,"isn’t that all common knowledge for every programmer tho? also, i feel like it is missing the biggest thing which is maintainability and that is a danger imho"
11634,101 advanced cs terms would be the perfect follow up video.
11635,Easily your best video. Keep up the great work!
11636,I like to think of the shell as a plastic weapper around a piece of candy. 🍬
11637,"&quot;It&#39;s called a shell because it wraps the kernal&quot;<br>I know what a kernal and shell are, but surprisingly never realized that refrence."
11638,"I can safely say this video has encompassed everything my 4 year degree has taught me. Great coverage over the field as a whole. If I could of shown this video to myself 4 years ago I would have known nothing, but through school I now know everything mentioned here. Great video and I love the work you do."
11639,"Congratulations , you have completed a CS degree 🎉"
11640,Oh 101 in binary...
11641,there goes my batchelors degree
11642,Make a video on printers!
11643,Proud of myself for knowing almost all of these concepts. I don&#39;t even have a computer science degree. Aside from that incredible video!
11644,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m21s"">12:21</a> that is not a valid IPv4 address"
11645,as flys to wanton boys
11646,Could you please create 100 seconds of each data structures and algorithms in programming?
11647,Maaaan that last one hitted to close to home.
11648,Hey! Its not fair! U literally said everything which i learned in my 4 year CS degree.
11649,My posh friend: &quot;Oh my god i dont want to learn code<br>......I want to crash the code&quot;<br>Me: you just code it will crashitself
11650,"I’ve been a hacker and pen tester for close to 5 years now, I’ve hacked into more companies than I could count and I still can’t get Gran’s printer to work"

11652,"@Fireship will you make a second part explaining all the new cloud concepts like  docker, kubernetes, databases. This will be great even after years for a quick wrap of all the googling I have done so far."
11653,"Printers aren&#39;t comp sci, they&#39;re based on black magic and warp fuckery."
11654,I just born and nurse recommended your video to me and now i am in NASA <br>Btw i am 12minute old
11655,These are all pretty basic concepts that all developers should know about. Along with encryption and general security.
11656,I need to understand point 70&#39;s code a bit more. On face value it makes me feel like a child trying to read for the first time.
11657,Bob bros... We can&#39;t keep losing to chad!
11658,Wow!...Really needed this stuff😂😂
11659,"Irony is, you only understanding this stuff you&#39;re already into computer engineering..."
11660,could you make a serie about data structures? I would love to watch this topic with your style.
11661,i get it! AL-GORE-ithm!
11662,Thats gold content to impress HR on the first interview
11663,How much time to create this video 🤯?
11664,&quot;Today you&#39;ll learn the science behind the garbage code you&#39;ve been writing&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂
11665,"Dude, Computer Science is amazing!"
11666,Alternative title: Computer science degree in 13 minutes
11667,Just how?!
11668,"Great video, But the database was not touched in this😂"
11669,Huge job and impressive results
11670,A lot of this is stuff I know but it’s a nice refresher
11671,Imagine if my Compsci teacher actually covered this stuff. Yeah that&#39;ll be the day.
11672,Tha video
11673,He took the &quot;Create a story with these words&quot; questions in childhood too seriously.
11674,And now imagine 1 hour of smthng like this:))
11675,"This style is the best, I love the theory, best video yet!"
11676,"Imagine stooping so low that you’re being taught basics of computer science by a javascript developer, fml"
11677,Hmmm Hexidecimal (sic)  ... nummy....
11678,"I look forward to all your content, but the History Channel Alien Wacko guy on the thumbnail?!  lol. You threw me for a sec. Almost scrolled by."
11679,"I&#39;m graduated on CS, but still I don&#39;t know what the heck I&#39;m doing (Thank you Stackoverflow)"
11680,heck yeah! still got it
11681,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m09s"">5:09</a><br>Am I having a stroke or are the big endian and little endian examples the exact same?"
11682,"Time to get my CS degree certificate after watching this video<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>😅"
11683,"This is the best video about CS by far, every beginner should see this before going for CS <br>Thanks dude"
11684,5 years of my life in 13 minutes
11685,Possible 100 sec of Delphi?
11686,You should make a series on networking
11687,Damn this is probably the best video of yours I have watched
11688,"It hurts to be that guy, but Binary Search isn&#39;t divide and conquer, it would be more appropriate to call it divide and discard"
11689,hats off
11690,13 minutes to sum up most all the subjects in CS degree! great job!
11691,Legend
11692,Omg that last fact is so true
11693,Liked commented shared downloaded
11694,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a> Big Endian and Small Endian form are same"

11697,THIS SERIES GOES TO FULL DSA. WE WANT ALL OF IT.
11698,Amazing 🔥
11699,Printers suck!
11700,101 lol. you should have shown the clip from office space.
11701,Already knew everything :/

11706,"Nice keychron k3, the same i have."
11707,Great!
11708,actually it contains more :)
11709,this video contains the same amount of knowledge that cs college students remember after 4 years of torment.
11710,Not sure if its an easter egg but an ipv4 address cannot start with “456”  🤔 but entertaining video!
11711,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m09s"">12:09</a> - caught you in  4k 60fps . 🙂"

11716,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=2m09s"">2:09</a> is that a Keychron K2"
11717,you literally just summed up the last 5 months of my life in about 13 minutes
11718,"Well we nerds watch it anyways .... : ) , good job mate : )"
11719,What an intro
11720,The printer comment brought back my ptsd. And I am an IT guy only doing coding for fun. Also I have to point out the 456.x.x.x IP address.
11721,This is the greatest video for CS ever! 🙌
11722,Great video. Try if you can make a detailed video about types of algorithms
11723,first time on this channel using python to explain things
11724,Amazing!! All those terms clicked with visuals and context.
11725,Did anyone actually learn anything new from this video?
11726,Whole computer science concepts in 10 min
11727,Does the thumbnail say what I think it does...? If so that&#39;s not okay man
11728,If you don&#39;t know how to fix PRINTER you are not worthy 🔨

11733,I feel like I learned more about OS in this 13 minute video than I did an entire semester of Operating Systems...
11734,"The thread and parallelism part is wrong, but otherwise very good explanation."
11735,"Yea, nothing beats being a programmer and hearing &quot;how the hell are you even employed?&quot; from your in-law, because you can&#39;t bypass his forgotten laptop password, because he never set up a recovery drive like you asked him to a year ago."

11737,"I swear, the more and more I watch your content, the more I believe you&#39;re some form of libertarian; the classical liberal interpretation."
11738,that... was... dense... I like it

11740,AL GORE ITHM 😭😭😭
11741,now you can pick up your CS diploma at the corner store.
11742,you never fail to deliver.
11743,awesome video really surprised to see 100 topics when i was expecting a 100 sec video.<br>please upload a video about MATLAB.
11744,101 - is 100% fact.
11745,"The amount of information in such a short video is astounding. Not only that, but very understandable too."
11746,Best video so far
11747,Legend 🔥
11748,Just finished mu engineering degree in 2018 and its fair to say that this is a great video.... Learned so much so that i didn&#39;t learn in a whole year of engineering.😂😂
11749,This is the cure for imposter syndrome!

11757,"@Adowrath Ah, ok, got it, true."
11758,"@Ralf Vogler Was just referring to your last sentence regarding `if random then x = 1 else x = &quot;a&quot;`, that&#39;s all."
11759,"@Adowrath Not sure what you mean and don&#39;t know Ceylon, but union types are also just statically inferred. If you&#39;re talking about something like polymorphic variants in OCaml or struct types in TypeScript, then the types are just joined/intersected depending on co-/contra-variant position."
11760,"@Ralf Vogler *unless the language natively encompasses Union types, like Ceylon (though I think an associated definition is required or else inference fails, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve used Ceylon). Your point still stands though of course."
11761,@Bwallker For the compiler it&#39;s a new variable that just uses the same name. I don&#39;t know Rust but I assume it&#39;s just shadowing the old binding or replacing it. That doesn&#39;t mean that you can change the type of a variable. In a dynamic language you could have a program point where you have a variable that has reaching definitions of different types (if random then x = 1 else x = &quot;a&quot;) which can&#39;t happen in a static language.
11762,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> I think the important part of dynamic typing is that types are determined at runtime, and not at compile time. What you described is type inference, and it is not tied to dynamic languages."

11764,This video has gotten me to subscribe. I hope i pass my exams... lol
11765,"Thank god, now I can quit my cs degree."
11766,"WOW 10/10, with this knowledge, no grandmas will be let down!"

11769,love it!!! thank you
11770,"actually in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=3m48s"">3:48</a> you should use double quotes for character array"

11772,"I&#39;m graduating with my CS degree next Friday, but I&#39;m still watching this video because there&#39;s absolutely no way I&#39;m skipping a single Fireship video."
11773,The end regarding the printer is so accurate lol. I could be rich for how many times I wasasked to fix a printer or something tech related
11774,brilliant!
11775,I still get nigtmares about pointers and printers it was hell and i just got my CS degree
11776,"I&#39;ve always wondered, Do you write code and then delete full words and play it backwards or do you copy and paste it or do you type it and do jump cuts or WHAT FOR GOD SAKE??????"

11780,Cool
11781,CS degree in only 13 minutes😮
11782,My degree in under 15 mins...
11783,@Philolaus I remember the Linus tries Linux videos.... when Linus is surprised that his printer works out of the box on Linux!
11784,"Printers in enterprise are a legit PITA. There&#39;s thermal receipt printers, they are their own special bit of fail, and we can go on forever about the different brands and interoperability with other brands and other OSes."
11785,"I love the ending: <br><br>I&#39;ve been developping for over 10 years now, and still there is 3 things I hate about computers<br>-&gt; Printers (That stop to work for no reason)<br>-&gt; Email setup (and all the additional shananigans that is added to &quot;try&quot; to prevent spam)<br>-&gt; Routers (that you have to plug and unplug in a certain order otherwise they can&#39;t figure out by themself how to autoretry connection to the modem)"
11786,"This is absolutely amazing, you took 13mins to cover a degree of about 4years, had a lot of fun watching this...."
11787,Do I still need a computer science degree?
11788,"I think I am going to use this as interview questions for my startup haha, good job :)"
11789,Thank you
11790,Wow this video just concluded my degree in cs in just 13 minutes!
11791,freaking printers man. so im not the only one haha
11792,Man you broke down my entire 7 years career in 13 mn
11793,"if an program deallcoates all of its references and all of its blocks are reachable, does it necessarily halt?"

11800,@fmstyle OMG I love this answer. I thank hou a lot and thanks for the time for answering
11801,"@Gba Gba Compiling is the process of transforming your humanly readable code into machine instructions, so it normally returns an executable, that is the code you wrote, but already compiled. Scripting languages like PHP or javascript are read and interpreted in the moment, that obviously makes the code a lot slower, but has its advantages depending what you&#39;re doing. <br>I&#39;m personally a fan of C++ because I love computer graphics programming and audio developing, tasks which require performance which is given by the language.<br><br>I always recommend learning C++ because of pointers and low level stuff, then you go to an interpreted language and understand what&#39;s more or less happening under the hood."
11802,"Why I feel so naked with only js, maybe even node, and some MySQL or mssql I use for free somewhere? And I tell you it looks nice, it has a chat room, with users, on click it gives you geolocation, and you can create or delete any data table you want, and you can query data to make double entry tables, and I invented all that in no more than 3 archives of nodejs (with something of 1500 lines of code I guess). I don&#39;t even know what njinx is I just deployed it in heroku. Can anyone say something why I feel like I have achieved everything needed without knowing a single thing about dart/angular/react/AWS and all that fancy stuff I see all the time? I&#39;m not joking I don&#39;t know what the hell react is and I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s needed. I do implement JSON web token for sessions but that&#39;s like the most complicated thing ever. I know how to use socketio (whose author is a fellow countryman), I fetch APIs and they display dynamic info, I do APIs with PHP, and I don&#39;t see how would I need to learn what is docker, digital ocean, and so. I happen to not know how to twich things when it&#39;s about resources speed, and I don&#39;t know how they work things like https, or DNS, TCP, UDP, NAT, IP adresses, I don&#39;t know what compile means. But I do fully functional good-looking complete sites with useful functions. Please someone say something!"
11803,"@Purplox we get it, ur a virgin move on"
11804,"Not gonna lie, I’ve been feeling that hard imposter syndrome with learning to code lately, even after finishing freeCodeCamp’s JS course and feeling a bit lost but going through this entire video I can confidently say that I understand and know how to code 80% of what you mentioned here which has helped substantially with boosting my confidence that I’m on the right path. Thank you for always making such high quality, humor filled, and easy to understand videos on these topics. I also can’t overstate how helpful it is having code, images and graphics to relay such complex concepts. You’re a legend mate! 🍻"
11805,wow this is absolutely legendary explaining
11806,"if you would have made individual videos on any one or few of these topics, it would have been actually helpful for someone who is trying to learn that topic"
11807,"who is your target audience?? someone with a CS degree? - they should already know all this, and most probably have a working understanding of it.. and for someone who doesn&#39;t know it, this video is not at all helpful for them"
11808,You are good
11809,This is incredible
11810,"Most compilers are often build out of 3 things,<br>A lexer - breaks the code down in an array,<br>A parser - translates the text in the array to assembly code,<br>And an assembler (also known as an assembly compiler)  - translates the assembly code to machine code"

11821,Bravo once again jeff
11822,Disappointed you didn&#39;t use RFC 5737 for the IP addresses... and one of them isn&#39;t even a valid IP address
11823,You could make a religion out of this!
11824,even if know 99.99% of these concepts it watched the whole video it feels comfortable and it is beast work well done👌
11825,Quali☕ content
11826,The first thing you learn in computer science is Fibonacci number
11827,Mind blowing.... a beautiful tour... 👍

11830,Programming == Computer Science LULW
11831,Elm
11832,The best explanation ever. I am studying computer science and this was unbelievable good summary of all to pick.
11833,I agree on the statement about the printer concept
11834,Last printer one was really useful.
11835,holy shit im feeling like im doing a programming speedrun
11836,Do you know programming ?<br>Me with a CS degree : no
11837,Wow this is the most useful video I watched a while.
11838,"I had computer science classes in high school and I&#39;m only now making the connections between the concepts that I had to learn back then, not to mention this video taught me more than my teacher did in 4 years... smh"

11845,Garbage collector can be so mean...
11846,Bruh the pilot💀
11847,printers lmfao
11848,More depth
11849,this is such a great video. Really well thought trough structure and sequence of topics. Also Everything concise and to the point. I love it!<br>(Kinda proud of myself for knowing each of the Concepts aswell^^)
11850,"This video is a w3schools for CS degree, huge respect 🙏 for Jeff"

11854,The last thing was so true as in A level CS they ask you to describe the internal workings of I/O devices
11855,This is your best video yet. Congratulations!
11856,Was looking for this comment too
11857,was looking for this comment
11858,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m08s"">5:08</a> The lower row of numbers would be swapped for little Endian notation"

11868,Legendary!
11869,This is great.
11870,"yup, there it goes my whole semester lmao"
11871,so that&#39;s why it&#39;s called stackoverflow...<br>you keep recursively coming back to find more answers to answers you found on stackoverflow
11872,Printers will always be a problem
11873,you are confusing dynamic/static typing with strong/weak. dynamic/static typing describes a variables ability to change type
11874,"Wonderful, more please! As a cs major your language videos have been great for figuring out which languages I want to try in the future, and other videos have been great review material! Thanks Fireship!"
11875,Wtf i acc learned something from a fireship vid ⁉️
11876,@D. Sherman Yes the object is just an abstraction to define the encapsulation of data and function that alter that data.
11877,"@marquez But under the hood JS is still prototype object OOP lenguaje,"
11878,"Not even just that, OOP is a pattern where the operators that act on your data, are together with your data. <br>In contrast to functional where the data is generally dumb objects which can be passed into separately defined functions which operate on them."
11879,"JS has classes, but I get your point"
11880,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=10m20s"">10:20</a> the main concept of the OOP is no the class but the object, you can have OOP lenguajes that do not uses class, like JS which use prototype objects."
11881,Now do a video on each one these concepts please
11882,"What a script Man 🤯 Hats Off 🥳To you !<br>and Us who took 4 months 😑 to learn these 🥲<br>Which he ruins in 13 mins 🥲🥲<br>But appreciated MAN ! 🤗"

11885,TIL I/O means input and output
11886,Thanks for refreshing my memory about computer science...
11887,I realize what a nerd I am when watching this despite of knowing already all the terms
11888,"Shoutout to StackOverflow <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=8m25s"">8:25</a>"
11889,i love you
11890,My entire four years of Computer engineering (UnderGrad) syllabus has been covered in 13mins... I want my money back
11891,Fireships voice is so soothing to the ears. I watched the video twice
11892,What language do you work with?
11893,@Aditya Painuly i still don&#39;t agree lol. I kinda like memory management. It&#39;s the only part if my code that works
11894,"Hard, used as a synonym for tedious."
11895,"I&#39;m sorry, but memory management is not hard"
11896,JavaScript is no longer single threaded. Browsers have web workers and nodejs has worker threads for parallelism
11897,This is a work of art. Thank you.
11898,"Not gonna lie. Point 53. &quot;Expressions&quot; really got me mad! To blame Javascript, the terms defining expressions REALLY CONFUSED ME! But now...I know....Thank you Fireship!"
11899,Poor Bob. Nobody likes him
11900,This is such an amazing summary of information. It really is incredible how succinctly you can explain these concepts.
11901,LOL! Awsome! and the finish is indeed hilarious!
11902,Is it just me or this video does not have a 1080p version. I am so mad lol
11903,Nice consept I love it
11904,"I was waiting the whole video for the explanation of number 101, i now understand everything."
11905,"Yes, grandma essentially I&#39;m studying printers, that&#39;s good enough."
11906,"Ahh, its like im back at uni, crunching for a parctical exam the day before. <br>Honestly tho, this was a nice lil&#39; refresh"
11907,"❤️ great , please do make video about ip addresses"
11908,I&#39;m adding &quot;PhD in Computer Science&quot; to my CV after watching this
11909,i watched this on 2x speed
11910,C++ FOR HATERS PLEASEEEE
11911,This is a masterpiece! Thank you
11912,lol 13mins i am done with CS degree
11913,@Sajidur Rahman lol
11914,"I would add: installing windows, setting up all sorts of IoT devices and, more recently, figuring out why a motherboard sporadically doesn&#39;t POST"
11915,😂🤣lmao
11916,The 101st computer science concept in the video is the off-by-one error.
11917,101 really resonated with my soul
11918,No one can deny that the most important CS concept in this video is 101st computer science concept. You just simply cannot let grandma down
11919,bro you just did what I learned in 2 years of school lmao.. great f*<b>*ing job you legend *wait for it</b> DARY guy
11920,The printer bit ... so true!<br>Or the wifi router ...
11921,4 year of concepts crammed into a single video. loved the video
11922,completed 4 years of CS degree in 13 minutes
11923,printer is an incredibly difficult concept to understand
11924,"@Para Boo but can&#39;t they compute anything &quot;computable&quot;, like I mean something like in the halting problem, we call it incomputable because a turning machine can&#39;t compute it???"
11925,"​@SF CS have a little play around with scala, tail recursion <b>can</b> replace for loops and in scala its recommended u do just that.<br><br>Personally I like to use a mix. recursion had been mostly useful for node trees for me"
11926,A degree is just a piece of paper.
11927,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=10m43s"">10:43</a> &quot;a class by itself doesn&#39;t actually do anything, instead it&#39;s used to instantiate objects&quot; - this needs to be revised as well. But yeah overall a great video."
11928,Amazing job yeah
11929,"I have a master’s degree in CS. This is surprisingly accurate and entertaining. The part about hashes could have been fleshed out a bit more. Aside from that, great!! Also, completely true about printers."
11930,"So.. by saying 100+, you actually meant 101"
11931,My whole 4-year degree in 13mins!
11932,I wish this video was existed when I was studying computer science. It is basically a visual dictionary of computer concepts. Brilliant!
11933,"Wow, I just had a flashback to when I was still in class, playing with my phone, doodling, and not really learning what I was supposed to learn. What a waste of money."
11934,"Insane video, as always!"
11935,A entire computer science college course explained in 13 minutes.
11936,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> So, that&#39;s how you pronounce Dijkstra"
11937,I also pity the guy having to read through some code that regularly made use of binary digit notation only to find a bug because there was 1000111000000010 instead of 1000111100000010.
11938,"Depends on your use case. Hex allows you to directly read off bit patterns in a more compact way, while decimal requires successive divisions (or bit shifts). Math and engineering applications tend to use decimal digits for greater familiarity, but low-level bit manipulations are far more convenient in hex. If you see binary digits, you&#39;re hardly dealing with anything longer than 8 bits at a time, or you have a bit pattern that has a lot of repetition that you can mentally filter out."
11939,"&quot;Humans have a hard time reading binary so most often it&#39;s represented in a hexadecimal base 16 format&quot;<br>as if hex are any easier. I personally find binary easier to read than hex, but they take too much space. Decimal FTW"
11940,You are an amazing creator 💥
11941,How the hell the you plan this whole video ? So well structured
11942,Hi. Is it possible to remove the guy from the first picture of this video? I don&#39;t like to see victims of electricution. Thanks in advance.
11943,I didn&#39;t know I needed this.
11944,"you don&#39;t use decimal system when counting on fingers, you use unary"
11945,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=12m09s"">12:09</a> - I&#39;m very sorry friend but the address on the right ain&#39;t an IP address 👀"

11949,I graduated after watching this video 😂
11950,Ug printers....<br><br>Great video as always
11951,"why not put the whole IT-Knowledge easy and understandable into a 13 minutes-video, why not 🤯"
11952,I get the feeling I will watch this video many times as more and more concepts begin to click
11953,Haha penguin
11954,Did you just spell OOP like... &quot;woop&quot;...?
11955,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m28s"">5:28</a> unless you&#39;re called lua"
11956,"They&#39;ll be an ever present concern when you&#39;re dealing with binary data formats and protocols. Also, text encoding formats that involve multi-byte characters."
11957,Love how seamless the transition between concepts is. And am I the only one who just learned about big and little endian??
11958,How to scare a JS/Python developer : *
11959,"What a great video, thanks!"
11960,"Mistake at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a> little and big endian are displayed the same way"
11961,"Was just about to say that, might be due to having a computer engineering degree"
11962,big ego boost when you realize you know and understand every concept
11963,this is genuinely CS in a nutshell
11964,"Dude, this video escalated quickly !!"
11965,Duuuude! that&#39;s incredible.
11966,I fell to the ground at the 101 concept that’s exactly how it goes if you’re unable to fix anyones printer you better refund your CS degree…
11967,OMG! My four years CS degree at Math.round((4*365*24*60) / 13)x speed 😄
11968,did he just covered my entire data structures and algorithm course in 13 mins ??
11969,waiting for how to fix A printer in 100 seconds 🤣🤣🤣
11970,My multi thousand dollar college journey in a 13 min video. 😭 <br>Great video for topic reminders and to better inform me on other certain topics
11971,10 years of my life just in 13 minutes
11972,Did he mention scope?
11973,Bro it&#39;s really great .
11974,Jeff is basically a new David J.malan ( teacher of CS50 )
11975,"I&#39;m sending this one to every Junior Developer with a &quot;I don&#39;t know how to, and am terrible at Google&quot; attitude...<br>Also I&#39;d like to take a minute to appreciate the printer twist closing screne. 😅"
11976,"Amazing video <br>Loved it <br>After a hectic day wasting all time in college and not learning anything, just to get a degree <br>This video was somewhat like, yeah atleast I did <b>something</b> productive<br>Maybe more videos like, you explaining solutions to some tricky questions, or explaining some data structure or algo in few minutes?"
11977,You just compress all my college classes into 13 minutes video
11978,You just summed up my 3 years college computer science course in 13 minutes...
11979,"@Tom M yes but the comment Writer only memorized his own phrase 1:1, so when an other person explains it with his own words, he isn’t able to understand"
11980,"the explanation in the video is quite fair. floats have a fixed-size mantissa, and the point floats by virtue of the adjustable exponent.<br>that is in contrast to fixed point arithmetic, where the numbers don&#39;t have an exponent but the mantissa is divided into integer and fractional bits and fixed before all computation. integers could be considered a degenerate case of fixed point numbers. one could also have fixed-point numbers with all-fractional bits."
11981,That&#39;s literally what he said
11982,@Hannes - its also refered here as a domain name server
11983,The decimal animation was clearly implying just this lol
11984,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> it&#39;s actually called a float because the decimal point is &#39;floating&#39; instead of &#39;fixed&#39;. That is float gives you variable decimal precision instead of fixed point numbers that give you fixed decimal precision."
11985,loaded with info😎
11986,kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
11987,You are CS god.
11988,You’ve just summarized 4 years I spent in college
11989,Fuck yes! Insta-click.
11990,imagine being called &#39;computer scientist&#39;<br>after writing print (&#39;bye dad&#39;)
11991,@Andres Perez What&#39;s a funny story of one such clients?
11992,"And that Turing Machines require &quot;infinite memory&quot;, rendering our current computers only &quot;equivalent to Turing Machines up to a point&quot;"
11993,"Also, it is important to know that there are unsolvable problems, or at least unsolvable using a turing machine,  no matter how &quot;good of  a computer scientist someone is&quot;. For some people this is obvious but in the industry is funny how many times a client asks for a software that solves the halting problem."
11994,"This is really important to remember with multithreading, because that&#39;s an example of something that some languages people actually use cannot do."
11995,"This is really important to remember with multithreading, because that&#39;s an example of something that some languages people actually use cannot do."
11996,"In my opinion, it&#39;s important to note that turing machines aren&#39;t able to do EVERYTHING, of course. they are able to compute anything. (at least, everything that is solveable.) This can be important to remember with turing complete languages, because they may not be able to communicate with drivers on your computer even if those drivers exist and work. Imagine a language which can calculate anything, but can&#39;t run shell commands and has no access to the filesystem. You cannot make files with this language. Or a language with no print command. You cannot make a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program with this language."
11997,Brilliant.
11998,til that cpu and ram are abbreviations
11999,Informative ✨👍
12000,I can be Senior Engineer (self-proclaim) after watching this
12001,@surkesden hopefully you degree had more concepts and teached you deeply
12002,I don&#39;t believe that I wasted 4 years of my life for computer science degree.
12003,Yes... someone should make a guinness record for the same.... most cs terns explained in 100 sec... :)
12004,Congratulations on your Guinness record for teaching 100+ things in 13 minutes
12005,Now jeff has pass the limit

12007,upvote if u want a full fireship vue3/firebase course!!!!!
12008,Watching this at 2x is so satisfying 😌
12009,I&#39;m have now unlocked 80% of my brian power.
12010,"Byte is too specific for a CS major, you should have said a &quot;word&quot; that&#39;s made up of N bits<br>Edit: the printer had me laughing out load ngl"
12011,school is for dummies.
12012,Oh wow a year of computer science just in 13 minutes.
12013,"i think you explained the turing machine a bit wrong. it can calculate anything on an abstract, but its more about math than about the given examples."
12014,Fireship is just getting better and better...
12015,You are the best.
12016,Can i get a participation medal 🎖️?
12017,It&#39;s called Big Endian<br><b>cue Indian music</b>
12018,Man I love this
12019,This is great!
12020,"I&#39;m studying computer engineering and my best best tip is: just go and fucking make things, think of something you want to make and make it, you will have problems, well, go and fix them, use google, read docs... If you just sit your ass watching videos, following and copying code, watching roadmaps and stuff, you will not make it anywhere... Just make stuff"
12021,@Aurelia speak for yourself genius
12022,You are right
12023,"Because web dev isn&#39;t something like mathematics or anything it&#39;s just labor. That&#39;s not necessarily bad, you get to be more practical instead. First you get a good job then build side businesses and then finally team up with the mafia gang and build a unicorn."
12024,Always curious 👨🏻‍💻
12025,"It&#39;s fun how learning is more of a speedrun these days which acts as a very good starter, motivating us to learn the remaining stuff by ourselves and now we have something of a map which we can follow instead of blindly jumping into stuff."
12026,You just summed 4 year of my CS Degree
12027,Holy shit this is well done.
12028,No I’m pretty sure computer science is witchcraft
12029,I read the first sentence with Karl Jobst voice

I&#39;ve been using my prior knowledge in my career in Adobe Photoshop and video editing programs but it hasn&#39;t helped me get closer to my dream of creating a game.

Which helped me understand why the littlest of error can throw the whole thing off. The while communication thing from user to programing language to ide to compiler to binary to computer is helpful.

I&#39;m sick and tired of trying to understand things. I&#39;m, 19 years old with no permit and license and is still in high school. senior year. with some help with my tutor. but he doesn&#39;t really specialize on the things that I specifically need to do. he just helps me pass my classes. I have an iep. and stuff. all I want to know is. how does certain things tell the computer what to do. what potential do they have. and what can I do with it. I want to know specifically what is going on with the hardware and software. I don&#39;t understand math that vary much. well how other people tech it. like how do you tell a computer to make a window  and display an image. how do you implement the image. and how stuff like public void is created. what is it. what does it do. and most importantly. why is it required. I want to know every specific detail. on why what and how things do things. let me give you an example. lets say someone doesn&#39;t know what 4+4 is. so they ask you. you respond with. 4 + 4 = 8. but they ask how did you get that 8 where did that 8 come from. how is 4 + 4 =8?. the correct response would be saying. &quot;put 4 in your head. and say for in your mind. then say 5 out loud and lift 1 figure up. then say 6 and put another figure up. and keep doing that until you hit 8. then look at how many figures your holding up and count how many figures your holding up. and if you said four. then you know how 4 + 4 = 8.&quot; the wrong response would be rambling on about stuff and saying big confusing words. and stuff. which most people and search engines do."

12702,lol
12703,I have a question for @freecodecamp if some one is new to coding and in a computer science major what should beginners as my self start on first

Right now I&#39;m searching for an IDE to start(I&#39;ve tried Visual Studio, too complicated, didn&#39;t like it). From a programmer family friend,  I&#39;ve been suggested to learn python first, even though I want to be a web developer in my 16 and 17s ( I think javascript and HTML are best for that), but there&#39;s plenty of time to learn. You guys did a splendid and useful video, that&#39;s still being watched to this day! Thank you!"

12770,Chewing something in the whole lecture😁
12771,Thank you
12772,i think it’s generally recommended to start out with python as its syntax is understandable for beginners the most due to its bigger resemblance to normal english than other programming languages ^^

12823,Thank you so much...
12824,"&quot;Start off smart&quot;, lol...<br>Im just starting a Masters in CS now after about 4 years space from my Degree. I would say these attributes are useful:<br><br>- Get used to studying for long periods of time (reading and understanding), The Pomodoro system is very good for this. <br>- Practice picking up on key words in text and making really organised notes. (notes are probably the no1 key to passing exams).<br>- Learning how to write and structure assignments is probably an underrated skill that you should practice. <br>- Get familiar with what CS or any degree entails, look at the university course content that is covered and do some research into what each unit/subject is about. <br><br>Theres more but these are probably the most useful upfront. - Best of luck."

12846,"The video covers a lot of topics and only gives a few examples and explanations, so its totally understandable that it is hard to swallow. This content would normally be covered for at least a year, so please don&#39;t feel bad about it. I suggest you learn some really basic coding stuff like printing &quot;hello world&quot; and follow beginner friendly things to get a feel for some of the concepts. After that, this video could help explain to you the concepts you&#39;ve encountered. I personally already have prior basic experience so I was able to follow along. Other people also seem to be experienced and have regarded the video as a very good refresher of the fundamentals.<br><br>Maybe you just need to be a little hands on first, then the discussion. I find that way to be the easiest to learn the material as I would already know what thing is being talked about and it also gives me curiosity and interests to motivate me to learn.<br><br>Good luck~°•"

12896,"@Varsha Jana At this point, you should not get confused. Suffice to say that the screen can be thought of as a console. The code comes from the button we press. Please also note that, subjectively, this video has an accuracy level of around 98 percent. The rest is either unclear, missing, or misinformed."
12897,"@Varsha Jana Perhaps, as a newbie, we can understand console as a screen where we can input a command. Thus, by this definition, a phone screen is also a console as we can input all commands and execute that command by pushing the button to make a call."

I searched for a video, then have to remember to unmute or when I click play, no sound🙄 then I have to go to quality because  it’s terrible. No way to adjust settings, settings are gone after last google update. Lol. Your video came up in random auto play line-up, after one I chose finished.

12934,Would this help in steps to becoming a software engineer?
12935,Absolutely amazing vedio
12936,@Betzon Nice work. Those are very simple questions. I was thinking more about a quiz with multiple choice questions etc. Harder questions that will make you think a little bit too.
12937,"And an example of how I reply (in this case to question 1):<br><br>Answer 1:<br>- The process of preparing an instructional program for a device. Attempting to<br>get a computer to complete a specific task without making mistakes. The more<br>exact instructions the computer gets, the better it will perform it&#39;s task. A<br>computer is not intelligent on it&#39;s own. Programming makes the computer<br>intelligent. A computer is much like a human, we both need knowledge in order to<br>perform various tasks. The computer becomes as smart as the human makes it.<br>Filling a program with as much details as possible is in other words what should<br>be done, so that the computer may execute the wanted task flawlessly.<br>- Programming is done through binaries (ones and zeros), but code writing has<br>various languages. Codes are converted to binaries within the computer. Much like<br>a human learning a new language in order to speak to somebody from another<br>country, a human must learn a coding language in order to &quot;speak&quot; to a computer.<br>- Programming languages can be split into two main categories, &quot;low-level&quot; and<br>&quot;high-level&quot;. Where high-level programming languages are such as Python and Java,<br>while &quot;low-level&quot; are such as Assembly or C. The lower level a language has, the<br>closer it is to pure binary code. Languages are therefor a matter of preference.<br>Learn all programming languages in order to become a master, but start with Java<br>and/or Python."
12938,"Question 1: What is programming?<br>Question 2: How do we write code?<br>Question 3: How do we get information from computers?<br>Question 4: What can computers do?<br>Question 5: What are variables?<br>Question 6: How do we manipulate variables?<br>Question 7: What are conditional Statements?<br>Question 8: What are arrays?<br>Question 9: What are loops?<br>Question 10: What are errors?<br>Question 11: How do we debug code?<br>Question 12: What are functions?<br>Question 13: How do we import functions?<br>Question 14: How do we make our own functions?<br>Question 15: What are arraylists and dictionaries?<br>Question 16: How do we use data structures?<br>Question 17: What is recursion?<br>Question 18: What is pseudocode?<br>Question 19: Choosing the right language (explain why).<br>Question 20: Applications of programming (give examples)."
12939,"They have 20 &quot;questions&quot; in the beginning, each question is answered through the parts of the video. I made a text document with the questions before starting to view the full video, I then reply to each question as I progress through the video."

I know, even before the internet, we had and still had libraries, which people could&#39;ve learned so much, yet it&#39;s so hard to break that mentality that like oh I can only learn in a class/school/college. <br><br>I have just come to this realization, and wish I would&#39;ve known/realized it ten to fifteen years ago. I&#39;m 28 now, I could&#39;ve been so much further in life. Instead of just wasting so much time.

12978,Thank you so much for this amazing video!! It&#39;s so easy to follow
12979,Oh thank you for this.
12980,Nice! I prefer f-strings or even commas because concatenating can get messy and it require extra work for converting non-strings into strings using the str() function.

13007,Today is day 3<br><br>I&#39;m back to this video to finish hopefully. I started a free python learning course on a website but I keep feeling like I need pre established knowlege whenever i get to the next paragraph and exercise. So I&#39;m here
13008,"I&#39;ve never learned anything about code, my degree is in foreign language and linguistics with a pre-law certificate, and biology is my 2 year degree, I work as a waiter in a high end restaurant where I&#39;m the only Westerner besides the husband of one of the Chinese employees because I&#39;m there to learn Mandarin &amp; while it&#39;s my 6th language and in 4 months I passed an exam it takes college students about 6 semesters of study to pass, I am not at all good at anything technical, never cared about any complex thing on a computer besides editing video which was just watching a YouTube video for every second of video lol and even that I don&#39;t get how is done, and I&#39;m bad at video games, and I&#39;m lazy as all hell. I&#39;ve tried starting videos or free courses to learn python, but I&#39;m always feeling like I don&#39;t know what the hell is going on and need to somehow cover even more basic stuff. It&#39;s like &quot;wait how does the computer know that the parenthesis means something, where are th 1s and 0s, how does this electric box even convert these sentences into English text, how does it know to put those pixels in that manner&quot; like I&#39;m just always questioning basics I feel I missed out on<br><br>I don&#39;t own a computer, I use my phone for everything, because I can&#39;t afford a $4000 editing or gaming computer despite always trying to save up for it, but I still am trying to learn code for the first time, and this video ABSOLUTELY was exactly what I needed. It covers all those hyper basic questions I had right away in the beginning. I could not feel more out of place by this challenge, videos about code talk about stuff I couldn&#39;t even conceive of like &quot;data structures&quot; or &quot;logic strings&quot; or something, and I have no clue what those even are, nor can I think of why I would ever use them.<br><br>I wanna figure out how to make my computer help with basic video editing, like just recognizing my voice in a recording or even in a script, and finding pictures or clips relating to what I&#39;m saying and automatically place those on the time-line on Adobe Premiere so it doesn&#39;t take literal months to make a single video.<br><br>Also I&#39;d like to learn how to make those quick clicking bots people use to make fast stock and options trades or buy concert tickets or limited edition objects in a millisecond because no human is able to make those.<br><br>When I started learning editing, the ideas I had about the creative things I could do grew out of nothing, like I literally couldn&#39;t have imagined some of the things I eventually did right at the start, the knowledge forged my creativity of what I could do because i knew what was possible. I am hopeful that learning code will have the same effect, it will help direct my creativity toward coming up with new ideas of what uses I could creatively have for code <br><br>This video is great, I&#39;m literally below an absolute beginner, I feel like I&#39;m below zero, like im a negative beginner because of confusion I&#39;ve gotten while trying to learn, so this has ABSOLUTELY helped me and I am eternally grateful. I will surely come back to this many times as I go along.<br><br>If anyone sees this comment in a week, a month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, a year and a third, a year and a half, 2 years, 28 months, 3 years, literally any period of time in the future, PLEASE do me a favor and reply to ask how it&#39;s going. I give up on a lot of things or get discouraged or stop because I get disillusioned after real world experience and application, or get distracted and fully forget. So PLEASE if anyone sees this, check in on me, ask if I&#39;m still learning coding or what I&#39;ve used coding for. I want to hope when I&#39;m 30 in 2 years I&#39;ll be a proficient coder and will have even become wealthier through my use of code, and that people on the internet learning alongside me will be kind enough to check in <br><br>Yesterday I learned what binary and hexadecimal is, but today is my first day starting learning computer science or code, whatever the important one is for basics.

I have a mechanical engineering background, and I took a microcontrollers class in university to try and broaden my horizons.

Let me put it this way: the microcontroller had a red, blue, and green LED light on it that could be referenced in the code.

13037,"@Kadiri Victor i can upload a video of some shyt on utube and its still free. but is it good? does it have quality? nope... shyt is still shyt. in this case the video tutorial could be incredibly good unfortunately some idiot guy came up and put shyt all over with his slurrying babbling mouth. i dont even know why im so upset about this lol... maybe bcoz i found that guy is so superficial. i think he wants to show off that he is a fast talker, but everything he said is almost incomprehensible"
13038,"@az8868 you’re right, but remember it’s free."
13039,"@Thomas nono probably u only watch the early part and haven&#39;t arrived at the middle part? it&#39;s a long video but in the middle part that one guy starts slurrying about and talking very fast. i think there is 2 different guys talking here. one guy is fine he speaks very clear, absolute delight to hear him explain. however there&#39;s the other guy who&#39;s slurrying and talks very fast sometimes it&#39;s just completely incomprehensible. i know i&#39;m not trippin and i&#39;m not taking any drugs it&#39;s ramadhan."
13040,"Bro be grateful this video is amazing , and he is not talking fast thats how you normally talk"
13041,"if you can&#39;t speak clearly make sure you are not slurrying around trying to speak so fast. cant fkin understand what ur trying to say. maybe u don&#39;t realize it but if you can&#39;t speak very clear, it&#39;s better to speak slowly. what u did here is that you speak like a 4 year old but trying to act like a rapper. you sounded incomprehensible a lot of times. think."

This was amazingly consise (i think), but more importantly, The way these guys descirbed things was just SO good, breaking things down into their simplest elements and slowly building the way up to the bigger branches was awesome. So thank you greatly to all of those that were involved!!"
13047,Greatly appreciate your video sir. Thank u so much.
13048,Hey about that example that u used to explain modules I don&#39;t understand what u meant by that can some one explain that for me?!
13049,"Great information. The one guy talks too fast and is hard to understand due to that, but otherwise good material. Slow down and enunciate your words please! Like for real, you are consistently combining 3 to 4 words into one unintelligible word and I had to continue to replay your parts to try to understand what the heck you&#39;re saying. Also, have some water before you speak. Sounds like some serious cottonmouth."

13136,"I can’t describe how much I love this tutorial. <br><br>As someone who one day decided to learn programming as a hobby, I was very frustrated how many so called “tutorials” expect you to already know the basics before they even begin (basics is a loose terms, frankly there’s nothing basic about it to me!)<br><br>I really wanted to give up, I felt stupid every time they’d start writing out a line of code without actually explaining WHY those words were being used in that order, why they were written that way, the difference between a colon and a semicolon or a variable and a float. So to finally find one that explains things and in a way that makes sense… well all I can say is thank you for not making me feel stupid. <br>Maybe I won’t give up after all."

13310,I&#39;m new to programming and I want to get into it(specially computer ScIence) I want to take notes but I don&#39;t exactly know what I should take note of any tips just in case I want to learn other programming languages?
13311,but you seem to be explaining how to work the individual parts of the programs needed to program. a newbie needs something a little better than this my man
13312,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m03s"">44:03</a> Rows are sections that go horizontally from left to right. Columns are sections that go vertically up and down. (0,2) go down vertically to row 0 and then go right Horizontally to column 2 and you get Arnold. (1,1) you go down vertically to row 1 and then you go right horizontally to column 1 and you get Ben. Final Bonus example (2,3) you go down vertically to row 2 and then right horizontally to column 3 and you get Cal. I looked it up because this part confused me, Hope this helps."
13313,thanks for the video :)
13314,Thank you so much for this. I&#39;m about to start my programming journey and our professor wants us to start with C as our general purpose language.

13321,"I&#39;ve only just decided I wanted to attempt to pursue a degree in Computer Science because I can&#39;t continue to waste my time &amp; money for both a degree &amp; potential &#39;career&#39; in something that isn&#39;t worth it. I&#39;m kinda embarresed since I have zero experience in any of this but I&#39;m currently working through a course to get the qualifications to enter a university degree since they require prerequisites, I&#39;m hoping I stick with it. I&#39;m only feeling sorta uneasy since I&#39;m focusing so much on getting into a university that I feel like I&#39;m limiting what exactly I can do but I need to start somewhere. Idk, I think I&#39;m just stressing. The community of CS online helps me not feel alone as cringy as that sounds. It really helps knowing other people feel similar &amp; are only just beginning. I want to feel self-worth in the work/career I&#39;m pursuing &amp; not feel like a joke, so I hope that motivates me to not slack off."

13347,"As someone interested in learning how to code and getting into tech, I&#39;ve read that the main differences between coding bootcamp grads and CS grads is the foundation taught in a 4 year curriculum.

13459,Hello.. what videos or books do you recommend for a beginner?
13460,"Not really sure about this - note I&#39;m not a beginner but I was curious to see how someone would frame training for beginners.   I&#39;m only 5 minutes in, and I feel there&#39;s a lot of misconceptions being presented on what programming and how a computer works.  Granted, the details are not required but certain statements are very far from the truth and someone may feel they have to relearn things later if they take what&#39;s said here for granted.  It&#39;s always hard to find a framework that can be understood by someone who&#39;s never done programming before; one thing is abstractions another is giving the wrong impression on what is going on."

13606,I am watching this before I start a programming boot camp and I must say I was struggling with learning the fundamentals of computer science before i saw. this video. Also there was so much jargon used in the prep work I was asked to do on codeacademy . Everything you explain is. simplified perfectly. Also I was having issues understanding the use of Arrays and Hashes in Ruby but you explained that perfectly. Thank you.
13607,"What&#39;s pretty poor about this video is that there&#39;s often just a little too much text on screen while you&#39;re talking non-stop, and not enough time to both read the text and listen and take in all you&#39;re saying. The slides change too quickly. That&#39;s true even if one already knows substantially all of the content being taught. I dread to think how it must be for an actual absolute beginner."

13625,"A way most understandable for me to understand programming is like a math problem:  4 + (6 + 5)3<br>Now we might be able to know what this is, but let’s pretend we don’t.  So the thing is we don’t know what equations or expressions are and what the hell they are for and only accept answers straight out.  Remember, we don’t actually know the answer since we couldn’t even read the expression or is the same thing as not only do we not know the language that is in, we don’t what is meant even if they did say it in our language so keep in mind we don’t know neither.  A tool to help us with this is the order of operations.  Now, the order of operations is not the actual answer itself, but it is going to help us get the answer once it is applied.  Order of operations: PEMDAS would translate this equation 4 + (6 + 5)3 to 37.  So now the equation is “rewritten” as 37, the new solved answer aka the actual language and it’s grammar. Now we know what the friend said, and what they meant.<br><br>the computer turns a blind eye when you comment <br>So the function is the order of operations, and pemdas is the argument (of that function)<br>Allowed arguments are like you get to pick a specific thing (can order the whole thing, but optional)<br>Non allowed arguments in a function just gives you the whole thing and generalizes the whole thing automatically <br>Problem areas; functions, recursions, loops, <br>Learn more about oop<br><br>Left this here for me"

13634,"Recommendation.  When you started the topic with Arrays, it is better to start with the fact that arrays are different than lists in where a list can hold on different elements (String, Int, Bool etc.), while an array can only hold on of each element (Strings only, Int only, Bool only etc).  It will make much more sense throughout the rest of the lesson."

13750,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=29m20s"">29:20</a> I&#39;m a bit confused on this part. So when you use a variable and you no longer need it in the rest of the code, it deletes so the variables after it can run? What happens if you try to call for the variable again? Will it come back and then delete again when it&#39;s not in use or will it be gone forever? 😔"
13751,"So for the &quot;NullPointerException&quot; part I was confused and I had to watch it 3 times. I then realized that you had to put it there because it would be confusing to the watcher to see a blank piece of paper at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=27m47s"">27:47</a> . So basically when you try to call for a variable with no information stored in it, you get a &quot;NullPointerException&quot; in return. When you give channelName the Name variable, it links back to the content inside the Name variable which is blank. And so therefore its NullPointerException. 😫"

13842,Just hope there could be a little more touch on the function part. How did the values stored in argument variable boxes get passed into the function? Will the function create new variable boxes with passed in values or it just pastes a reference on the box? How does the function return the variable box to the outside world if it has a return value? I&#39;m expecting more explanations on this. The whole video is the best introduction I&#39;ve seen so far. It&#39;s perfect!

13906,"Great course and it&#39;s helping me a lot in understanding what&#39;s programming and how to start with it. Although, I&#39;d like to point out a mistake. In 2D array indexing there is a mix up between columns and rows. It&#39;s actually the opposite of what you showed or said😬"
13907,great video
13908,same man it completely baffled me
13909,@caleb4l it’s an error dude.
13910,I scrolled and scrolled until I found someone who saw the same potential mistake. I almost thought I was crazy. I hope someone can chime in and confirm or deny if its an error or indeed correct.
13911,"yup, exactly what I was thinking as well."

But it&#39;s not like its difficult to adjust the size of an array. There&#39;s numerous/conventional methods such as push, shift, pop, etc.<br><br>Or am I missing something here?"

14119,"Also I disagree on the catch-all belief that computers are &quot;dumb&quot; and by your implications that they are completely incompetent. A simple calculator is &quot;smarter&quot; than you. Yes, a computer is as smart as its programmer. But you discredit what an average home PC can do out of the box. I don&#39;t know any human that can computate complex equations at a blink save for possibly savants or be able to translate our language to binary and vice versa. So to call a computer DUMB is like saying a high school graduate is dumb because they don&#39;t have a doctorate. In the advance of AI we need to end the idea that machines are just stupid slaves. After all, who are the stupid slaves? The dumb computers or humans that rely on them that program them.?"
14120,I get that computer science relies on EXACT language; but I can&#39;t take this video seriously when you constantly misuse the English language apostrophe. Computer&#39;s... Variable&#39;s... Array&#39;s... You&#39;re doing your mission a disservice by preaching accuracy in one language while not adhering to the fundamentals of another. Thumbs down. Or should I say &quot;thumb&#39;s&quot; down?

14126,Thank you so much!
14127,I have a general question and i know it might sound silly but for example where can i read what functions a specific language provides and describing what each does? Is there a place where i can go and read about what each function does so i can use it in case i need it?

14146,"@lena lara it is a very good start for sure! the more you know the better but you will always be learning, so don&#39;t worry about not knowing everything from the start. maybe start learning the practical basics of a language you know you will be learning if you want to be really prepared as this video touches more on the theory! good luck"
14147,I  hope your classes are going well. I am going to start cs January but I have just some little to no information about itso is this video enough for me  or not?
14148,watched it all as a refresher to my first semester of CS and you literally covered about a couple dozen hours of lectures/reading into this short timeframe - amazing!!!!

14160,This is such a calming tutorial
14161,I love this course
14162,"Yes, I think it&#39;s a mistake. 1,1 should be Ben. And 0,2 should be Arnold."
14163,I&#39;m confused on finding elements in the 2D array. For instance I&#39;m thinking the name in the 1 1 position should be Chis. Also 0 2 should be Arnold the way I&#39;m understanding it. That is if the first number is row and second number is column.
14164,I love you Steven and Sean. Thank you so much for make this video.
14165,Ok
14166,"Just watched the entire 2 hours.<br>Thanks alot. I studied programming 1 on distance, which introduced me to C++ and the &quot;Hello world.&quot;<br>But i honestly felt like i learned it waay better and faster this way.<br>A broader approach to programming in general and then introduce the different variants was very helpful.<br><br>I never considered javascript or Python, since i practically only touched c++. <br>C++ and C# seemed a bit tough for me to tackle because right after the course, i don&#39;t do small projects, no i jump into making my first videogame, ye... didn&#39;t get very far.<br>I never had the chance to study IT in school because when i was a 16, it was 2010 and even so short as 11 years ago, parents were like &quot;take a subject that gives you an easy job.&quot;<br>Ended up studying electrician, which i havn&#39;t worked as for even a second after that. <br>And IT is so big it&#39;s very hard to get into, especially if you can&#39;t be taught it already from school.<br><br>So this helped me ALOT, im so thankful for it. <br>Python looked interesting to me, so im probably taking a peek at it."

However its been about 3 years since i&#39;ve touch any of it. I got so worked up that I felt I waisted the majority of my 20&#39;s (I am 29 now) learning programming, always feeling like I have no idea what I am doing, I don&#39;t feel I know anywhere near enough to get a job, and therefor I never will. So I gave up sadly, I am considering trying again I still remember the basics but yeah would need alot of google/stack overflow to get anything accomplished.  I really... really... enjoying coding, debugging, and finishing a project even thoough I&#39;ve only finished like 2 basic websites(I am very much a perfectionist.). Any advice?"

14254,"@Henry the fastest way to learn programming: become really efficient with your keyboard to the point where you can navigate without a mouse; get your typing speed to 45-50, learn basic keyboard shortcuts, learn terminal command, learn a scripting language and setup hot keys. Get a snippet manager to put all your basic code snippets and utility snippets and annotate and comment over them, and then setup a hot key for them. Also make projects your interested in. Then learn from the experience of others, study the best programmers. You’ll learn more about algorithms watching the competitive programming champions for an hour, than watching a 5 hour algorithm course."
14255,"@Henry it’s possible, but definitely a challenge, you really have to proof yourself, many company’s are now strictly enforcing degrees, the country did a complete 180 with job policies since last year, and removed trumps executive order that forced jobs to consider candidates without a degree. Say thanks to Biden lol. The job market overall looking pretty scary for everybody, going to school and getting thousands in debt may not be the best option either. Honestly can’t recommend anything at this point, but  adding stuff to your portfolio and applying to places while in your learning."
14256,"@Banguard you seem to know well in this field..So i wanna ask you, so without going to any computer colleges means without certificate if we jus learn programming at home by ourself are we gonna get job still???"
14257,"@Frost c#, java, python, go, or JavaScript your best bet, language don’t really matter in the beginning, except you probably want a higher level so it’s less details to Manage, and easier to work with, just choose one and stick to it."

14397,"Business Opportunity in Ruvol<br><br>I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  <br><br>It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” <br><br>The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.<br><br>HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?<br><br>I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0</a><br><br>BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!<br><br>It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.<br><br>You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>.   <br><br>Thanks and God bless!<br> <br>RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL<br>The Ruvol Inventor"

14613,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=5m27s"">5:27</a> I don&#39;t think it is fair to say that &quot;JavaScript is designed for smaller tasks while Java or Python can carry out much more computationally intensive processes&quot;.  JavaScript(Node.js) is faster than Python. Massive programs have been written in JavaScript. And with the use of TypeScript one can get the benefits of Java&#39;s types in JavaScript."
14614,what bootcamp did you assist and how much was it??
14615,Then that was not a good bootcamp

Bitcoin has undergone a strong rally since Monday low of $31,200, the leading crypto currency trades slightly above $14,000, analysts think that the coin will go more higher and undergo an upward explosion in price which makes now the right time to stack up and increase your portfolio aggressively and the only way to achieve this is through trading, that is why i trade with an expert Mr Maxwell Smith, through his trade I have successfully increased my meager portfolio 2btc to 9btc in 5weeks.

14646,how can i use this to commit credit card fraud ?!?!?!?
14647,@heisvi I got all that I was just confused cuz in the narration he said the numbers backwards. I was just curious what would happen if I typed it into a calculator not a terminal. And the answer is I confused my calculator.
14648,"@MajorMusician it&#39;s not percent, it&#39;s modulo.<br>It returns the remainder after integer division. <br><br>For example 100%7=2 because you can write 100 as 7*14+2, and modulo will return that 2 at the end."
14649,@heisvi lol yeah I got that one time but now I type it in and get the percentage times 3. I&#39;m talking about a calculator btw
14650,You&#39;re supposed to get 1. 10%3=1
14651,Am I the only one that got lost for a bit around 16 min when he says &quot;when divide 10 by 1 the answer is 3 remainder 1&quot;? Its got me a little confused cuz I typed 10%3 into a calculator once and got 1 but then after typing a bunch it now gives me 0.3 which is what I expected to get in the first attempt. Although I might have just been going a little crazy trying to make it work when I saw the 1.
14652,legend has it hes still asking  &quot;But what exactly are loops&quot;

14661,one of the guys talking sounds like he&#39;s eating/has food in his mouth and its kind of annoying.
14662,yeah this confused me as well
14663,"In the topic &quot;Arrays&quot;, it seems that the example in minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m09s"">44:09</a> is wrong, shouldn&#39;t it be Arnold [0,2]?, [row, column]?"

14759,I feel &#39;c&#39; isn&#39;t a low-level language. It is medium-level language
14760,"Facts, I think it may have been an error. But when I first learned about 2D arrays, I was taught the opposite to access the elements in a 2D. Don&#39;t know if the video is referencing a specific language and its rules."
14761,"@Blitz Mlcom From how I&#39;m understanding it, [0, 2] is relative to &quot;Index&quot; in the top left. The first integer refers to the position in the same row as &quot;Index&quot; and the second integer refers to the position within the column of that row position. So at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m04s"">44:04</a> for instance [0, 2], &#39;0&#39; refers to the 0 position in the &quot;Index&quot; row and &#39;2&#39; refers to the 2 position within that column. BUT the information here seems inconsistent with everything else that I&#39;m finding elsewhere online where the first integer refers to the row numbers on the left side and the second is the column numbers on the top. So [0, 2] is Arnold according to other sources. It&#39;s also confusing when they say to think of the 0th position as the first and add one in your mind. You should really just remember that positions start with &#39;0&#39;."
14762,"also noticed and went through the comments to see if it was a mistake, 7 months and no answer ahhah"
14763,true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14764,Was this a mistake?
14765,"So wait the indexing position in the 2D array at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m03s"">44:03</a> wouldn&#39;t 1, 1 be &quot;Ben&quot; and not Chris according to your own rules?"

14954,"You kinda lost me on the string variable, I understood every other variable and their function, but I don’t understand what exactly you mean when you say “promt user for name” are you saying the human ask the computer for its name or you’re the computer asking a user for its name? Cuz that’s how it sounds like you’re saying it. Please be a bit more clear."
14955,YANKEE STYLE hi sorry for the late reply! i have 0 background knowledge in programming. i am a tech enthusiast so i picked up a lot of things along the way and it led me here. check out harvard’s intro to computer science video. they explain the intro to computer science further. it’s on youtube if you search for ‘CS50’.
14956,Thank you for the great introduction! I took lots of notes and will be starting CS in college soon. Cannot thank the team enough for providing such a great resource and learning tool for free.

14994,<b>Really loved your video and had subscribed your channel &quot;NullPointerException&quot; too.</b>
14995,💙💙💙
14996,"Awesome tutorial. Thank you, guys!"
14997,"Wonderful course, I really love each page of it. Thank you so much for hard work. Subscribed already. God bless!"
14998,Decent.
14999,How good do you need to be at Math if you want to be great at programming?
15000,"Hey... Harvard has an amazing program. Introduction to computer science, totally recommended. (CS50)"
15001,U serious? Iam new here! No offence
15002,"Guys, more useful than Harvard !"
15003,Thank you for the free course!
15004,"Just wow, mesmerizing and awesome. This is the video that I needed to brush up the basics. <br>Thank you Steven &amp; Sean, @freecodecamp &amp; @NullPointerException."
15005,@Alex V Thank you bro🙏👍
15006,"Yeah I think this was a mistake,  it should be:<br><br>print (&quot;Game over,  &quot; + (4 + 4) + &quot; was your final score.&quot;)<br><br>The way they had it would result in a syntax error as the middle quote would be treated or looked as the end to the first set of quotes ending that statement."
15007,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=18m27s"">18:27</a> This might be a silly question but in this case you wrote ( &quot; Game over, &quot; + 4 + &quot; was your final score. &quot; ) <br>But in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=19m08s"">19:08</a> you wrote ( &quot; Game over, + (4+4) + &quot; was your final score. &quot; ) Why did you not use double inverted comma&#39;s after &quot; Game over, ?"
15008,I saw this video to C
15009,Who s  learning on Quarantine ???? Like
15010,"I don&#39;t know what part of the video you are referring to, but I think what you refer to is just string concatenation.<br>Basically if you have to strings: a = &quot;I love the number &quot; and b = &quot;123&quot;, in most languages saying a+b means you concatenate a and b, in this case:<br>a+b=&quot;I love the number 123&quot;<br>If b is an integer, by using str(b) you convert it to a string, so saying<br>a+str(b), given that a is the same as before and b is the integer 123, is the same as saying &quot;I love the number 123&quot;"
15011,But I thought we can&#39;t add integer and strings <br><br>Please explain
15012,Molnar attila im trying to self teach my self. Can you please give me some pointers? I don&#39;t know where to start thanks in advanced.
15013,"I&#39;ve been doing for a while self thought and I read many books and watched many tutorials, but this video was yet the best one. Clear explanation and awesome examples for illustration. Thank you NullPointerException! 🙂"
15014,"@Gytis Gytis I&#39;m sitting down too much in this lockdown already. ;-) I just wanted to warn people there are many mistakes here, I didn&#39;t optimize my comment to be easy to respond to. :-)"
15015,Wow your comment so stupid that its hard to comment on. Sit down boy and go learn basics.
15016,"I haven&#39;t seen a video with this many errors in quite a while. It seems like they made a conscious effort to cram as much mistakes in a video as possible. Just a single example: importing a single name from a module is not &quot;less taxing&quot; for a computer than importing the whole module (in fact it&#39;s the other way around), but it surely is less taxing for a human trying to read the code.<br>Oh yeah, and infinite loops do not cause crashes in any sensible way -- and it surely doesn&#39;t matter if they are written using a for or a while keyword. (That one way really funny, and made me believe they&#39;re doing this on purpose.:)"
15017,Great video. I hope more videos like this.
15018,"hey thanks for the video,<br>please provide the slides used in the video."
15019,@Andrei G. That sounds like a good idea. Thank you bro🙏
15020,"Being an absolute beginner, I couldn&#39;t grasp everything. I felt like you were going too fast. Still, I got to learn a lot. Thank you guys ❤🙏"
15021,"Let&#39;s eat, grandma"
15022,thanks FCC!  Ive been trying to learn this elsewhere so this was amazingly useful.
15023,"I found it helpful to think of variables as &#39;grasping&#39; values, rather than &#39;containing&#39; values. Think of your variable like a noodly tentacle. Thus you can have multiple variables &#39;grasping&#39; the same value, such as an object.<br><br>If your variable gets changed, the original thing it was &#39;grasping&#39; does not necessarily cease to exist. That object still exists in memory. Your variable simply became unbound from it."
15024,It depends on language. Every language have own syntax.
15025,"Add str(4) now you can&#39;t get error,"
15026,"There is a Syntax Error at min 19 when explaining String concatenation... <br>The tutorial says: <br><br>print (&quot;Game over, &quot; + 4 + &quot; was your final score.&quot;)<br><br><br>And you state that the console will return what the string concatenation succesfully and not the Syntax Error.<br><br><br>Try to fix that because it can be confusing to new coders."
15027,@Jayne Walters <br>Just slow the video down.  That’s what I did.
15028,Totally agree with this. I am struggling to separate his words to make sense :( I just have to skip and miss his bits out.
15029,It would be great if they could find a professional voice actor to narrate. Maybe a recent grad trying to build a portfolio would be willing to do it for a lower cost.
15030,"@DIRTYDAN Minor complaint but yes, correct. I think they might find that feedback useful for future tutorials."
15031,@Ram Ranch I think I did both those things.
15032,"Great tutorial but one of the two instructors (Steven) talks way too fast, with no pause and even slurring words occasionally! <br>I know I can slow the video down on youtube but it&#39;s a pain to have to do it at every change of instructor, which happens frequently. Also speaking so fast makes it a bit too robotic and boring to listen to with very little inflection in the voice :-("
15033,Thanks!!!
15034,I too was freaked out at first later I understood that they did it on purpose to make us understand a loop😅
15035,"hey! the video is awesome, I&#39;m absolutely enjoying the clear and concise delivery!<br>There is a small issue with repeated phrases, though <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m28s"">44:28</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m46s"">44:46</a>"
15036,Do you know how awesome you folks are! 🙌🏼🙏🏼
15037,Thank you guys for putting this together. Has a very short attention span during programming classes at college and university ... so this has been a wonderful resource for me to learn the fundamentals. <br><br>Hoping to learn c and python over the next few months
15038,Make your video then!
15039,First misleading statement - “this specific IDE is used to write Java code” - while this is true it is also misleading because to someone who doesn’t know any better this could mean they cannot use VS Code to write code in any other language other than Java. That is VS Code you were referring to in that image and you can use just about any language with it. This might seem like knit picking but it is an educational video and so it should be as close to the truth as possible without bias.
15040,😂 I thought it was a glitch
15041,It took me till the 3rd &quot;we&#39;re going to be talking about loops&quot; to realize what was going on. Lol very nice.
15042,I had to download this video so i can learn and learn always. Thanks
15043,Great introductory course 👏👏
15044,Who else clicked this and knows everything about this topic..... 😂😂???
15045,"Hello guys, could anybody help me  find videos to learn &quot;vbscript&quot;"
15046,"Dude, learn almost anything on YT for $free99. I have so many videos in my education playlist to watch."
15047,lol I just bought a $11.99 udemy course hours ago about this same topic....
15048,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m26s"">44:26</a><br>I &quot;C&quot; what you did there."
15049,Is there going a series?
15050,Can you do a course on gdscript
15051,Could you please upload a video on some basics in Matlab programing?
15052,Damn it is average informative.
15053,Make a video about network and Django
15054,"Not on the website but here is a transcript in a Google Doc: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1usWd3qGIRZeaMrlrbqYkKYi3KfaPosU4MizS-7q6D98/edit?usp=sharing"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1usWd3qGIRZeaMrlrbqYkKYi3KfaPosU4MizS-7q6D98/edit?usp=sharing</a>"
15055,I was wondering if there&#39;s a transcript of this video posted in the freecodecamp website?
15056,me too<br>far better than college
15057,I wish I saw this tutorial when I first entered college years ago
15058,Bring back Mike Dane
15059,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m26s"">44:26</a> watch in x2 speed"
15060,after watching this i understood that dont eat ur grandma
15061,"@Rishit Thakkar you probably didn’t watch the video entirely. So, watch to have the context. Thank you."
15062,do you know that you are able to write this comment because of computer and things you always use are computer computer can do more calcution than you. the video you watch is made with computer. so if compuers were not here you were not here commenting this things. thank you.<br>(be polite in the chat)
15063,akanksha vishwakarma why did you do this? :(
15064,Spoiler: Computers are dumb!
15065,the like to dislike ratio says it all
15066,Even though i might programming for an year i think this a quick revision of basics well done fcc❤️
15067,Pull your nuts 🥜 on the table and deal with it.
15068,I just afraid of c language what will your solution
15069,Awesome
15070,"Yes, at least in python. It works this way.<br>Not aware of other prog. Lang."
15071,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=19m05s"">19:05</a> <br>Maybe a little error there.<br>We cannot simply concatenate an int with strings without using &quot; &quot; or str() to first convert it into a string. Right?"
15072,I though we can easily add more value into an array??
15073,Very usefull information in quarantine time...tnq u very much ....keep going on All the best..
15074,I paid in lakhs to college got the degree but didn&#39;t have any skills..here freecodecamp teaches everything.. should we even be paying to college if everything is to be learn online??<br><br>why do we even pay their salaries
15075,Awesome. ❤ thanks
15076,"​@XaneGaming absolutely, I don&#39;t think you need to go to college to be a programmer, maybe 10 years ago you did, but now a lot of people from all professional backgrounds can become programmers. Anything is possible with the internet lol."
15077,I never take any bachelor&#39;s in CS do you think this is a good start on learning programming stuff?
15078,Absolutely. 4 years in my degree and this stuff is still a go to
15079,so how your cs journey going
15080,@J D how did it go?  its been  a year now.
15081,"I&#39;m finishing my bachelor&#39;s in CS next month and I&#39;m watching this because you never want to forget the fundamentals, you always come back to this stuff."
15082,That you great people. This video is what we need during this period.
15083,Great guide it has helped me a lot. Thx
15084,"Newbie skip to &quot;⌨️ (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=1h50m40s"">1:50:40</a>) Choosing the Right Language?&quot; LOL"

15088,"&quot;Whose&quot; denotes ownership. You meant &quot;who&#39;s.&quot;<br>Edit: I know, I know. I&#39;m THAT guy."
15089,me here
15090,i am looking for that comment &#39;whose learning during quarintine&#39;?
15091,U r in a invisible world
15092,😂 😭 I literally burst out laughing aloud.
15093,@Christopher Tran who designed A.I tho? Think about that.
15094,did you edit this like right now? couz its not what it looked like 2 minutes after ive seen this
15095,@Gamers_Arena Drugs R BaD MKKkkkkKkKkK
15096,Me at 3am : let&#39;s learn programming😁<br><br>Okay so after watching 20mins I learned <b>Computers are DuMb</b>
15097,Thank you so much for putting up this video! All basic concepts are explained in a really clear way in a really short time. I love this channel and how it focus in making complex ideas simple and accessible for anyone. It has been a great inspiration to create my own.
15098,"Thank you for all the quality content you continue to provide for us FCC! Also, special thanks to all the amazing Developers/Engineers in FCC&#39;s videos!"
15099,"Wow, where was this a few years ago when I was looking EXACTLY for this? xD"
15100,"Please make a video front and backed web development. <br>Using python,javascript php and html using l."
15101,Yeah u right. And we will.... Real soon
15102,"@Josie G. This makes no sense. Altough humans are still smarter than AIs (even with the most advanced machine learning techniques), it doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t surpass us or become smarter eventually"
15103,Who made the computer?<br>Is the human being.<br>So human being is the intelligent not the computer.
15104,Machine Learning exists to prove that computers can actually be intelligent!
15105,@Siraat Al Mustaqeem i’ve heard it actually and i’ve even watched the first two lectures but they started from the very basics that i already knew. maybe i should just skip a few and continue watching. thank you!
15106,"okay y’all thanks for the reminders maybe i should make a lil update, its been 7 months and i’m participating in programming and maths contests and also applying for computer science next year :)"
15107,@Hafsa Ryuzaki lol thank you for this
15108,Are you back yet?😂
15109,just a reminder to come back and continue learning :)
15110,"I haven&#39;t watched it till the end yet but I just wanna thank you for what you do, it&#39;s priceless"
15111,I like this lectures. Thanks I appreciate.
15112,i was going to say this as well
15113,The whole course could cost you some breads. dude gave it for free so I don’t know why y’all still complaining about a mistake. Thanks  man that was the best gift 🎁 I could ever wanted. You’re just a lifesaver ❤️
15114,"@Jacob P yea true, row &amp; collum might be mixed also... but like he said: we get the idea :)"
15115,yes i think this was a mistake
15116,"And maybe its just me but I think of it as column first and row second. Position (0,2) I go over to the 0 column then down the the 2 row. They refer to the first number as the index of the row number and the second number is the index of the column number and that kind of criss-crosses the way we already think about rows and columns.  I think the way they explained it can be a little misleading."
15117,"hey i realy enjoy the video so far... on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&amp;t=44m09s"">44:09</a> is there a mistake? 1,1 position should be &quot;Ben&quot; not &quot;Chris&quot; right? or am i mistaken? thank you &amp; keep up the good work!"
15118,shattap
15119,"Fcc be like, ohh so we taught java, javascript, python and all the other languages but I think we are missing something... Ohh yes we forgot to tell them what PROGRAMMING REAALLY IS !!"
15120,comment for yt algorithms
15121,yes
15122,@Hashim Amin yes
15123,Beautiful.

15129,THANK YOU FREE CODE CAMP
15130,Why is mike Dane not talking any tutorials now
15131,@PretzelChan <br><br>Probably committed suicide.
15132,How’d it go?
15133,Thank you! I have CS finals in 2 weeks
15134,erm why do you eat while talking @about 12minutes+ ?
15135,Really good!
15136,Just buy youtube premium
15137,I learned even more from the multitude of constant ads than I did from the video
15138,Now there are 10 ads
15139,Mgema akisifiwa tembo hulitia maji
15140,i got an ad at the starting lol
15141,Man we got this without ads is 😎
15142,@Kevin producciones 2 there&#39;s a video on this channel about ethical hacking so you might want to check it out
15143,"@Ribert Franhanreagen I want to hack, where can I start?"
15144,"If want to be hacking, start from the most fundamental, and focus on the lower level language like c"
15145,Edwin Basa he codes in C
15146,"const char x[]{ 0110, 97, 0x00 };<br>printf(&quot;%s %c%s%c&quot;, x, 0x68, &amp;1[x], 10);"

15151,Thank you
15152,Thanks for all your support  🙏 . You are truly incredible
15153,Im’a that as a sign this is where i should start 😅
15154,Because i just found it
15155,"@Manny that must be the most untrue thing ever. I&#39;ve found some of the best teachers in the field of programming only. Other than that, in other fields, I didn&#39;t find a single proper instructor or lecturer. Let&#39;s not be ungrateful for the amount of free material we have."
15156,@Sidepocket The Southy ঐও
15157,Good thing I found this.
15158,Finally.... Why didn&#39;t y&#39;all start here? 🤗😄
15159,The best video
15160,Liked your picture 😀😁
15161,Liked the video before watching it.
15162,@Hanma Enjoy and have fun? Elon must be drunk when he said that. Colloges are nothing to enjoy or have fun. Everyone are working their a$$ of.

15168,I am from India and you make Hindi language video
15169,@Corey Perdue what kind of job then?
15170,@Corey Perdue that&#39;s so wholesome dude. glad i could help! have a nice life :)
15171,"@Sophia H thanks, my life has seen so much positivity in these last 10 months! I appreciate you adding to that"

15289,"@Anurag Rai number of seats in IITs are not sufficient for every talented one. Also the fact is more than 90% indians working at Google are non IITians. IIT is just a small part of the iceberg. My own unkle is a 5 level engineer as data scientist at Google, he is a non IITian, and he guides me as he says Indian students doesn&#39;t know a shit other than IIT. That&#39;s the reason why Google says &#39; no degree or certification required &#39;"
15290,"@Vrashabh Sontakke But that talent comes with intense hard work.<br><br>And preparation of IIT will teach you that.<br><br>IIT prep will teach you how to work on deadlines with intense stress giving your 100% in it.<br><br>it develops your lots of skills, increases your IQ and learning, listening skills with increasing creativity.<br><br>Increase your problem-solving skills, which is really needed in engineering and even business fields, coz advance&#39;s questions are based on IQ and deep learning. <br><br>Remember this,<br><br>&quot;IF I DON&#39;T HIRE ENGINEERS FROM INDIA THEN INDIAN ENGINEERS WILL CREATE ANOTHER MICROSOFT IN INDIA&quot; <br>                                  ~BILL GATES<br><br>Edit: And here bill gates is talking about IIT engineers, and others skilful ones.<br><br>College doesn&#39;t matter untill you get into IIT/NIT/IIIT."
15291,"if you do hard work to get into IIT, getting good Job becomes easy.<br>if you dont crack IIT, then you have to work hard to get a good jod.<br>You have to do hard work, whether you crack IIT or not.<br>I prefer not preparing for IIT, cause i can use that ammount of effort to learn the actual programming and DSA stuff and not physics, chemistry, or maths which is rarely used in the industry.<br>Also, there is an aspect called &quot;competion&quot; to get into IIT, you need 99.99 % marks to crack. LOL<br>And the most imp thing is that all big tech companies in india are biased against non IITians which makes it harder to get into those companies.<br>The solution for this is applying at startups, abroad or as a Remote Software Developer which gives you more package than Amazon, Microsoft or even Google here in india."

These are childish things to mention which psychologically moves brain of ur viewers to the context &quot;Rookie 🤞🏽&quot; ..no personal issue vid ur content, but STAY BEASTLY."
15782,That’s my Day in my life placements edition. I am preparing for companies that’s why i am coding for so many hours.<br>Don’t judge before knowing the full story.<br><br>Mentality ki to baat mat karo ye channel scratch se grow kiya hai jab bache assignment bana rhe hote hai. Cheers!

16681,Sir you are the best.just love your content<br>You&#39;ll soon hit 1M
16682,Sir how much math need for programming
16683,"I&#39;m about to go to college to study this, now I&#39;m scared"
16684,😂🤣
16685,as a cs student i agree
16686,nah what they thinkin is true<br><br>im lazy
16687,Im a bio student and i think its more difficult than bio!<br>Programming is more logical and broads ur thinking !
16688,arts student left the chat
16689,Absolutely not I hate both maths and computing I can wait till college till I can do sciences
16690,"Me as an informatics student who married a Computer sciences student. That&#39;s true, I have no idea what he is doing but I&#39;m sure he can&#39;t Program at all"
16691,Thats ez the answer is 4
16692,Is this what awaits me? I&#39;m sobbing
16693,"honestly that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking and yes, I will take cs in college and regret it later"
16694,Are software eng and CS the same
16695,i was into computer science.. <b>was</b> 😢😂😂<br>am the worst at math but i guess i can try i am really interested
16696,Shhhht...stack overflow
16697,I&#39;m starting to regret my life choices after seeing this...
16698,1. Logic<br>2. Series<br>3. Functions
16699,The maths is hard but if start self studying maths 1 hour/ day. It is easy.
16700,In TV shows:<br><br>“Just gotta break through this firewall… and we’re in!”
16701,As a CS student this can&#39;t be more accurate
16702,Thankfully I’ve barely had to touch any math after graduating lol
16703,I fking hate maths<br><b>Proceeds to get a programming major</b>
16704,"When I learnt HTML and CSS in class 8 I thought computer is easy and interesting so, I took computer application in class 9 and after learning JAVA and PYTHON I came to know what actually it is"
16705,"funnily enough my experience was not like this really. I only had to take two levels of calc, one of stats, and any of the math I had to do for other courses was never this bad (sometimes the books were actually this bad, but not the way those topics were taught by the teachers)"
16706,Thanks for spoiling everything 😒😒
16707,Even CS students can&#39;t digest that complex math and end up doing testing.
16708,And in the end you don‘t need all that stuff.
16709,I wish I would&#39;ve known before two semesters in 😮
16710,Easier than chemistry tho.
16711,Don&#39;t forget &quot;can you fix my printer?&quot;
16712,Main mar bhi jaunga na tab bhi apne laptop ke saath ye na karun😂😅
16713,Hacker typer is awesome
16714,hhhh   is crazy😂😁😁🤣
16715,I&#39;d recommend you to learn just basic. it is looking awful like python.
16716,AtLast All Of My Effort Took Was To Print This &quot;Hello World&quot; 🙂
16717,Its basically math but extended edition
16718,Relatable 💀
16719,Computer be like: hay Bhagwan Kya zulum haiiii😂😂😂😅
16720,There&#39;s literally no difference. I have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.
16721,Applied mathematics 🥲
16722,😭😭😭😭
16723,No matter wherever you go maths will forever haunt you ✊✊<br>Life goes on and on
16724,The last picture 🤣🤣
16725,"cs is mainly based on maths (local algorithms, combinatorics, graph theory and much more), you just teach a computer to follow some set of heuristics unless it reaches some x position that is desired"
16726,I am saying for ai/ml/ data science works you need high level maths but not that much for some development and coding.
16727,seriously what is your age?
16728,Ai/ml/data science required high level of math
16729,"Unless AI/ML/Data science ,  you don&#39;t need high level maths ."
16730,"A bunch of wizards of oz, a few modest efforts, and the rare insane developer who made the rest of their efforts possible. Many layers of this over time lol"
16731,Pray for me I am also going to take computer science 🙏
16732,"Some programming languages and paradigms, Linux and then a LOT of mathematics<br><br>Made me haha, good video"
16733,"Yes, I write codes with my feet, any problem?"
16734,the you&#39;ve reached your question limit tho 💀
16735,I’m studying propositional logic and I can’t find out why you’re using valid formulas of propositions in computer science.
16736,Same thing
16737,And computer science Jobs are totally opposite 😁
16738,That person in the last is dead !!
16739,Bro i died when i saw the f(x)
16740,I had anxiety looking at those definitions or smth
16741,Bca is also same
16742,Proposition logics f*** with my brain swear to god
16743,"this actually triggered me, all the logic propositions, almost made me cry of fear"
16744,Computer science is basically Math on computer.
16745,What it actually is:<br>Copies it off stack overflow
16746,Read a peoblem - think you know how to solve - 1st attempt to solve - buggg - being stuck and non productive for ... a very long time - come back with another appraoch - repeat the process for ... god know how many times 🥺🥵
16747,"The most accurate video to show what pain we feel as a cs,, btw which song have you used at last"
16748,aww the discrete maths...
16749,&gt;question limit<br>mmuahahhaah good one
16750,Math is also included in information technology (btech)????????
16751,"People still know about CS, the most mysterious field is BBA."
16752,Annnnd I just gave up on my dream
16753,true
16754,Hi i want to major in computer science but i have no knowledge in calculus. Do you think its possible for me to do cs without prior knowledge in calculus or physics?
16755,so linear algebra
16756,Being a Cs student ain&#39;t easy
16757,"i do coding,python and it is so tiring!"
16758,"A friend of mine who was failing in math throughout high school decided to major in computer science. He told me that all the complex math equations was killing him slowly. Fortunately, he did say that it was fun. His love for coding and video game is what’s keeping him going. Haven’t talked to him in 2 months, I hope he’s doing well."
16759,the perfect disguise doesn&#39;t exi.....
16760,"Well no and yes , this is cs but it&#39;s just 20% of it , or less we don&#39;t use it daily (the discretemaths and statistics or theory of computation) it&#39;s for most students a college class thing"
16761,Ayo why does he look like a NPC😭
16762,i still have that one bug in my code
16763,How funny!😇💓
16764,YUP
16765,"It’s all about math, i’m suffering same thing too 😢"
16766,What&#39;s the song name?
16767,"This is so true, don’t forget to mention losing 90% of your social life because you now live and breath constantly studying. Don’t also forget the fact that on top of your cs classes you are most likely on your own attempting to learn like 3 languages at a time. 😂 stay strong kings, we got this"
16768,"Sadly, a lot of &quot;Computer Science&quot; degrees in the UK really do just boil down to 3-4 years of programming.<br><br>Every time you learn a fundamental concept your assignment is to just code it up in Java, or maybe C.  Depends on what pet language your module tutor has chosen.<br><br>On my CS degree literally about 70% of my assignments involved some kind of code.  That and a summer internship meant that I took the decision to not just fall off the conveyor belt into a software engineering role like most other grads do."
16769,It’s mostly theory at university out of the 4 year degree maybe 15 percent is programming
16770,My non CS Student friends :  &quot;What the f*ck are you doing&quot;<br><br>Me : &quot;I don&#39;t know what the f*ck I&#39;m doing either&quot;
16771,"Now I can realise why this is called science, full physics 🤣🤣🤣."
16772,the way he waved his arms😂
16773,🙄
16774,"Yeah, I graduated in computer science, but I&#39;m  just a programmer and I sure ain&#39;t doing science."
16775,oh lord i’m terrified for whats to coem
16776,Okay so what is it really???
16777,"dude showed just some glimpse of neural network and machine learning, it&#39;s just the beginning<br>be careful with what you choose"

16786,fax
16787,Thats why i dont go to college. Just learning the actual shit
16788,cs more like computer math

16805,Hackertyper ☠️☠️☠️☠️
16806,As a CS student I can feel it🙃
16807,Ngl the equations look sexy. But i can guess it&#39;s pain using them to solve problems...
16808,computer science ❎<br>computer mathematics✅
16809,Why does the math have to be discrete. Why do the models need computation. Why is it neither truly linear or algebra. Thank goodness I didn&#39;t have to take differential equations.
16810,thats why ill just finish my tech school and couple cisco courses except CS College. I dont wanna learn maths material that will be useless in 50%

16886,I deeply apologise
16887,Ok well this just made my day worse

16911,Ahh yes that is I
16912,Maths pakka hona chahiye usme kyuki mein to 9 th se coding kar raha hu teen saal ho gaye function relation matrix permutations and combinations ka boht used ata he also statistics <br>And all formula for basic pure maths
16913,"After getting a good college with CSE<br>Me : Ah man this physics and maths fked me so long now i gonna chill bro<br><br>CSE : You sure bro?<br><br>Maths and Physics : you chose to get away from us but, we had another plan<br><br>Me : Ah shi-"
16914,I just chose cse in data science and this is scaring me 🤡
16915,Dark web hacker ban jao 🤣
16916,siriously yrr its so confusing for me  i just leave it now and doing online mba.. in starting i think computer science very easy like ms word excel 😂😂
16917,Leave me alone😳
16918,True
16919,Design algorithm 😵
16920,can confirm: I spent 12 hours just to complete a section of a neural network. that section isn’t even done yet smh
16921,"Thank god i took chemical engineering in IIT kharagpur (2nd year 3rd sem) , i was getting cse in IIIT lucknow but opted for IIT  (anyone would chose IIT over IIIT unless its hyderabad cse). Life is much easier in chemical as compared to my friends in cse. For those saying cse will earn more, you dont know the salary the chemical engineers get at tier 1 pharmaceutical companies."
16922,It contains beautiful abstract algebra
16923,Welp guess I’m not gonna do computer science anymore it looks too complicated
16924,Just you wait
16925,"If that’s where you’re at rn, buckle up baby. Lol"
16926,"Goddamn it, I never want to see another p or q or not q in my life 😂😂😂"
16927,True
16928,DFA 😂
16929,🤣🤣🤣yes
16930,You thought that aswell before choosing cs
16931,Lmao 🤣🤣🤣<br>My guy tripin
16932,WAIT!!! <br>I just started learning Python... Is Python based on math?
16933,Lmao dude sleepin
16934,Idk about stockoverflow man is that new shit out there xD
16935,"No one code in real life, they copy paste from stockoverflow and geeksforgeeks 😁"
16936,Hidden layers .. AI 😑
16937,4 new math subjects waiting for me the next semester and the other 4 those i failed:
16938,true bilkul true har kisi k ghar main ye samaj te hai k Cs bacho ka khel hai lekin jab karne bhetenge ghar wale toh nani yaad agaye gi
16939,facx
16940,should I still study computer science
16941,"minus music + stack overflow, then perfect"
16942,Which laptop do you use
16943,relatable
16944,Ok I am starting to question the choices I have made of going in to it and computing looks like it’s gonna be a hard and painful journey
16945,"Literally, im on my first month in college and its so hard. Its all based on math, everything is math math math"
16946,@Vijay i took and now i don&#39;t think it&#39;s only about coding lol it&#39;s about formula too
16947,Bruh I am about to take cs💀
16948,Why don&#39;t i watch this before taking cs 😭
16949,The company already destroyed 🤣🤣🤣
16950,Meanwhile  whitehat Jr.
16951,Ok
16952,Very accurate.
16953,"Or me who spent 3 hours looking for an error. Just to find I forgot intizlize I,j = 0 in my for loop"
16954,Yeah I&#39;m glad this wasn&#39;t the age old stack overflow joke. Because CS is mostly theoretical stuff.
16955,"expectations: data structures, algorithm, programming and chill<br>reality: dbms, operating system, computer networks, toc, compiler, computer organization, digital logic, mathematics &amp; dsa and + many more subjects"
16956,"I&#39;m just glad i got through in online classes i had that semester i had to take algorithms subject, compiler design, networks, computer graphic design, that semester was the hardest one ngl."
16957,Overaction
16958,dude thats maths
16959,wait that exists?
16960,"i&#39;m fu--ed, i think i&#39;m going to give up on my dream"
16961,every degree is hard bro just go for it
16962,"Oh no I was about to choose ics tomorrow in college, even though I am not good at maths, what should I do now plz somebody tell me😰"
16963,"You forgot to mention about stack overflow, seg Errors and pure rage."
16964,"I respect you,bro. I’m also interested in it."
16965,artificial neural networks
16966,"print(“Hello, World”) <br>I AM THE HACKERMAN"
16967,All that and you work as a frontent developer using html and css only.
16968,I&#39;m so glad i discovered your channel
16969,That&#39;s physics 🤣
16970,😀😀😀
16971,the stackoverflow one hits me hard
16972,Now I got it..<br>Why cs students say &#39;&#39;I love maths&#39;&#39; 👀
16973,is computer science raelly that much math?

16996,"As a <a href=""http://b.tech/"">b.tech</a> CSE student, agreed 👍🏼"
16997,🥺💀💀💀😭😭 i choose cs because i was one of those people who thought computer is -----------+---------------------
16998,that poor mac book
16999,Right bro
17000,True bro i am also a cs student
17001,M studying Salesforce n I fell asleep anytime i study

17007,in reality. We mostly copy and Paste The Codes.
17008,Still .........
17009,And then you get a compilation error😭😭😭
17010,Don&#39;t scare me im on my 1st sem🥲🥲🥲
17011,@Déépãk Jãtãnã yeah and I also would like to learn computer science :( so that then I could learn AI
17012,"No that is computer science ,I hate computer sceice but I love programing ,jab bc hame hi calculation karni to ye daba computer or programing kis bat ki 😟"
17013,This seemed to me it is telling me to stop dreaming about being a programmer 😂
17014,pls tell me this is not true<br>i just started cs
17015,Excel may I come in
17016,No one no one thing that programming is easy
17017,"90% of the time is googling stuff and trying to find codes to copy and paste, 10% is looking for a random mistake like not adding a ; and 100% of it is pain. Absolutely love it"

17032,I&#39;m just getting into Linux and honestly it feels like this 😆
17033,Ayy have fun 😂
17034,After taking cs  I looked in video  and from Monday to I am going to start my first  cs classes  😅🤣
17035,I wanna do cs but idk if I&#39;m gonna enjoy the math. That is too much
17036,You ruined my fantasy.... You bast***!
17037,My parents think all CS people do is stare at a screen and sleep. Accurate.
17038,Applied maths 😍😍😍

17046,Let&#39;s not forget the 5 hours of debugging
17047,I need more videos like this that explain what computer science is
17048,Being a computer science student u scared myself bro...
17049,"Nop, bye 🏃🏻‍♂️"
17050,You forgot a lot of crying.
17051,Meanwhile:<br>In interview<br>What is stack over flow? <br>Write some code? 💀
17052,Gotha bro
17053,thats probably computer engineering... computer science involve coding and software related...  computer engineering involve mathematics and hardware related
17054,That was deep learning ANN network...... And 90% CS graduate don&#39;t go there... The most suitable branch for this artificial intelligence is electrical engineering and ece.... Because the level of maths use by the ece and electrical engineer in their subjects are most suitable for these artificial intelligence subjects.
17055,You scared meee
17056,Then what is physics &amp; mathematics
17057,Yesss none will understand our pain
17058,than just leave it... there is vacancy for delivery boy in Amazon

17071,Like ppl that creates Roblox games on Roblox Studio is supposed to know this. No wonder why there is SO MANY gui scripting vids.
17072,I know bro what is a pain of computer science 😂 because I am a student 🤣
17073,Only legends know that the website name is hackertyper
17074,Oh lord and i though that was easy
17075,i think everyone thinks it’s the latter… it’s just youtube trying to convince everyone else that CS is easy coding that will land you a 100k in 2 months worth of effort..
17076,You mean its mathematics?. I never see them doing maths. Also they mostly use online scripts.
17077,love you too ❤
17078,Abey Bhai 😮😮😡dara dia . BTW love you bro
17079,"This is call pain🥲, those who know"

17113,facts
17114,I am a cs student
17115,L lag gaye
17116,Why they think it&#39;s so easy? 🤔😅

17121,Logic and prepositional calculus was quite fun
17122,Fun fact: this will only get recommended to most of the people with CS so we all already know what it is like lol
17123,But those equation are even in maths and partial derivatives
17124,people don&#39;t think in movies they show these so people think in that way please change ur title
17125,Song name? :o
17126,bro i am also study in computer science

17147,@Abbas He was joking in context to the Katy perry clip.
17148,@Abbas by any chance are you Autistic or on the spectrum ?
17149,@🔴Average study enjoyer Mathematics is an intrinsic component of science
17150,@Abbas is maths related to science
17151,"@Abbas I don&#39;t think so. Calculus may be easy but once you get into the weird topics like topology, abstract algebra, and number theory is when it gets really difficult."
17152,It&#39;s called computer &quot;science&quot; for a reason

17161,You may want to get an early headstart on your Final Year Project. Also don&#39;t forget to cook up a portfolio to use for your 1st job application. lol but srsly.
17162,1st year cs here. So far so good with the discrete structures. I think the other are calculus and have no idea what is the 3rd one.
17163,No… the majority of people computer science is just fixing computer electronics
17164,IT&#39;S just brakeys
17165,Honest answers only. Do/did you think CLRS is/was hard af?
17166,Totally true bro
17167,😂💯
17168,I think computer science not much harder with enough proper usage of computer awareness.
17169,I went into it thinking it was going to be mainly coding. I&#39;ve taken maybe 5 classes where we code in 4 years.
17170,"@aayush mundhe Bro don’t listen to these guys, you don’t need crazy math at all. Only time u do is for your doing machine learning. You can be a very savvy computer scientist with basic understanding of math, you don’t need to be an expert in all that extra shit."
17171,@BULLY MAGUIRE Flawed thinking. You can say that for every major. By that logic the conclusion is just don&#39;t study anything because eventually there would be more graduates and competition every year.
17172,@tyler durden • 57 years ago Yeah there r people but i am talking abt average. Why don&#39;t u think it logically every yr new engineers r admitted From best out of best so in that sense i am talking .<br><br>They can definitely enrol in different different companies but for that u need to study every time and there is very less job security and we all know their Hardwork.
17173,@BULLY MAGUIRE really? I know a guy who currently working in some it company what about that?? He&#39;s around 32 years old... Lol 🤣🤣
17174,Wait what ! You forced me to think whether I should take CS or not <br>PS : thank you for scarring me 🤯
17175,😂 no problemo

17191,At least it&#39;s not the quantum physics equations... Even more horrifying math there!
17192,Not cs but ml
17193,That looks like some alien language 💀💀😭
17194,no computer science is the easiest field beacuse a child can make web and app.all the solutions are available on code .

17198,I touch type fast and I’m going to start typing and waving my arms like that so that people think that’s how I go so fast.
17199,What is better in iit cs and maths or cs and economics
17200,"@JaFu py it&#39;s not about the syntax. Its more about how to manage everything in an efficient way. If you intend to study deeply programming in the future, I would recommend you learning C or C++ (not necessarily both) now."
17201,@Hoàng Duy I’ve seen the syntax. FACTS
17202,"If python is the pain, the C/C++ is a death"

17232,Can you give me the module?
17233,the only math needed is linear algebra tbh
17234,Hahaha principles of deep learning 😎 mujhe yaad aagaya
17235,Lol same did you get the answer
17236,Wait now I&#39;m rethinking whether I should take CS or not wtf 😭😂

17242,probably i got banned like that in stackoverflow &quot;telling me the limit... lol&quot;
17243,The first topic is easy mathematical reasoning p negation q aur p implies q
17244,The guy is just casually asleep at the end. Just like nope I&#39;m done
17245,Bsdke job he karle  content to ban ne raha tujhse cringe    bana raha hai😂😂😂😂😂😂

17249,@vipul nair reinventing the wheel if it rolls better
17250,"You are reinventing the wheel,DONT reinvent the wheel."
17251,"That is hella impressive coding in C 😂 I literally wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing with pointers/memory management stuff, I&#39;m very much a kinda guy who appreciates my compiler doing all of that lmao. Sounds like great stuff though, keep up the grind I&#39;m sure ur gonna create some amazing projects!"
17252,"I am a girl who programs almost exclusively in c because its my favorite language. I know some c++, python and some rust(learning currently) but not many other languages fully. I decided I&#39;d rewrite my 3d engine in c because the prototype was in python which was unbearably slow and not good for any game ideas i had. Yeah turns out i can&#39;t even find a good way to display stuff to the screen and am struggling to find documentation 😔<br>I want to do everything from scratch in terms of the math but don&#39;t want to have to create the window from scratch. Then all the matrix multiplication....in c. This will be so painful. At least i plan on using the wonderful q_rsqrt algorithm from quake 3 for inverse square roots because that uses c pointer math and pointer fuckary. (It converts a float pointer to a long pointer so it can bit shift it to the right by one (essentially divide by 2 round down) then back). Personally i love pointers and don&#39;t like it when i don&#39;t have access to them in code. But in the end the most confusing stuff is organizing everything, finding good documentation and the damn math. And sometimes you make a mistake like mix up a + and a * and you get screwed over(happened to me recently)"
17253,Okay I learnt loops yey.<br><br><br><br>Later : wtf is for-each loop bro 💀
17254,Ngl sometimes I&#39;m not even sure myself 😂

17257,@Grumpy plays Are you a Computer Scienctist?<br>I am not insulting I just don&#39;t know what its called to learn about computer science
17258,Its a field where you specialize in solving problems. Programming is just one of the ways you can solve problems.
17259,I think computer science is far from just programming. I think

17268,Yup
17269,CS is basically math made more hip
17270,I&#39;m honestly not familiar with AIML much at all aha so I wouldn&#39;t be able to say (altho if I were to guess I&#39;d say probably?)
17271,Bro for AIML is this much maths required? ?
17272,legit 😂
17273,Man I got A for my discreet math and hell if I even understand what that is
17274,@moniaeylül I learn that topic too in math computing along with some basic calculus (my fav topic) in IT course but it&#39;s not that hard than discrete math
17275,"What about linear algebra, lot of calculations..."
17276,I&#39;m almost forgot that I had learn other math instead math computing

17299,Don&#39;t come to coding just stay in your field.
17300,@solid batman Thank you so much for your time and response
17301,Idk much about coding but start with python it&#39;s easier to learn check tutorials on yt to learn its function and stuff and yes anyone can learn coding if they are serious about it
17302,"I am from Arts background. I am pursuing my bachelor&#39;s of arts. Can I learn coding or any programming language? By which language should I start learning programming language as a basic?

17318,I Like KI
17319,I just print stuff on the screen
17320,facts 😫
17321,Don&#39;t get me started with those randomized algorithms and designing secure protocols 🥲
17322,It will get a lot more complicated in the future; this is abit elementary
17323,basically a lot of math
17324,Nope this isn&#39;t true. As a student taking up CS I can say that those equations that he portrayed as hard is actually super easy even for a school student. So don&#39;t think CS is hard. It is the easiest subject of all.
17325,"So ... , i agree with this one"
17326,This stupid post is also a sin.
17327,"Romans 6:23<br> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>John 3:16<br>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,  that whoever believes  in him shall not perish but have eternal life.<br>James 2:17-18<br>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.<br>18<br>But someone will say, &quot;You have faith; I have deeds.&quot; Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.<br>Acts 17:30<br>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.<br>2 Timothy 2:19<br>Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”<br>(All humans have sinned except for the Holy Son of God that have lived a human form and became the sacrifice for the sins of those who believe in him. And also those who believe in him shall change into more like him.)"

Almost the entire cohorte in electrical engineering was arabic or african. African guys were cool but arabs would avoid white ppl. Berbers from algeria were also cool but they are literally whiter than me lol and i don&#39;t think they liked arabs?

17531,We High school students in India are smarter than the Computer Engineering Students and class +2 students are as smart as MIT students. We get more Pre-requisite knowledge of the core concepts as a base requirement and that helps us to learn better wherever country we go.

18241,thank you for sharing your expierence. Your speech was touching and amazing
18242,"After watching this video for you girl, I started to make a decision to become a codegirl"
18243,"Thank you for this, I have selective mutism and I&#39;m thinking about studying cs and this gave me a whole new motivation"
18244,"It&#39;s not about struggle to talk, its all about looks."
18245,She only got the speaking spot because she&#39;s white and (somewhat) conventionally attractive
18246,"Damn, should’ve watched these videos before my every exam. Like for example, chemistry Ted talks before chem, bio talk before bio exam"
18247,"Super annoying voice, be quiet."
18248,Passion to create &amp; persistent enough to keep trying ✨️
18249,"Don&#39;t learn to code, learn the concepts"
18250,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ1ehJqXor0&amp;t=10m40s"">10:40</a>"
18251,what is coding and what do you guys do coding for
18252,Wow very proud of her
18253,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ1ehJqXor0&amp;t=10m26s"">10:26</a> you also have the privilege of being a white pretty girl. <br>good job on your accomplishments though, this was inspiring, but it&#39;s not too realistic."
18254,Madeline <br>You are so beautiful...
18255,👍👍👍👍👍
18256,"But not purely for the sake of diversity. Focus on encouraging people of all stripes to be competent engineers, don&#39;t just throw them head first in the industry for the sake of a quota or the US will struggle to compete globally."
18257,"We need more female engineers, programmers, software developers in IT. Historically, IT has been known a male dominant environment. Time has come to put more focus on diversity."
18258,❤️
18259,I am a newbie middle school computer science teacher. I will definitely show this to my students. Thank you!

18273,"very cool. now, stop looking at the word nerd as something negative!"
18274,"Well, it is maths deep inside"
18275,Coding is not so difficult we should learn it from childhood like maths

18283,"@Daniel Here is one of those assholes. And yeah, Stack Overflow if full of assholes too. It&#39;s not even helpful anymore, so they&#39;re just useless assholes."
18284,Aww did you guys get down voted in on Stack overflow
18285,Nope CS prob made people more toxic
18286,So beautifully put: code to express yourself! Thank you!

18770,"@Areeba Mazhar Kamal well pycharm is a good one but it&#39;s never too late to start u can definitely watch videos free of cost on YT itself and try and grab various learning opportunities, Google and other companies do organise courses to help people learn. At this start it&#39;s pretty important for u to clear html as it&#39;s the very basic needed and is for outline on a website also then go for css for designing if u wanna go with python that means u are interested in app development so yeah u can go with that too very good option to proceed with rest again never too late to start something new and learn something extra. Best of luck buddy. Keep coding and learning. And prefer it as a treat for example complete a topic and give treat to urself of coding and enjoying that process is the most beautiful one trust me and in vacations enhance it further by giving or making coding projects. Baaki toh enjoy and appreciate ur failure and congratulate ur self on achievements 👍✌️👌"
18771,"wow😭😭 , i&#39;m recently doin my ninth and all messed up with this shit . but i wanna keep coding as a side interest as well . so where shall i start ? is starting from python considerable ??? and yes , i use phycharm as well ."

18932,@Prabha Phoreddy 🤣🤣🤣this is a career counseling session there are many career opportunities in gaming industry as well but the only problem is that some people don&#39;t know what to learn and where to learn these skills. So I think you get it 😏
18933,Gaming doesn&#39;t come under education
18934,SIR MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT CHOOSING A CARRER IN GAMING INDUSTRY

18958,CEO
18959,Baat toh sahi kahi demand supply case😎😎
18960,Super mam💯👍
18961,Saala kisi bhi branch ka student 50 thousand ki jab ke liye mar jata hai or milti bhi nhi CSE ka ek average student hi 1 year baad kamata hai.
18962,"Aap kisbhi college se B.A bsc ho no matter . Aajoa chahe jaha se ho company inta jaldi nhi nikalti. Or rhi baat is field ki isme ek normal student bhi 10lakh kamata hai aap kuch bhi nhi janti , buss gyaan deno to ho. Demand kitni hai or present me supply kitni hai . Graph bhi to dikhao. Seat khali jaati ladke nhi mil rhi . 75+ thousand companies hai only in india."
18963,"Aap jaakr aur knowledge lo CSE ek best hi hai koi job nhi aapya only CSE, rhi baat topper , average ki baat hi nhi hoti hai . Isme 10 company hi 50 lakh job deti hai supply hi bahut km hai . Aap ko to admissions ka comission chahiye."
18964,How long your are coding ???I am interested in technology and I am in 10th grade I am trying to learn languages can u give some tips
18965,Sach bhai
18966,Thanks man u r giving me hope 😀
18967,Past 25 years I am listening the same from so many guys.  But demand is increasing like Anthing.
18968,What is Reality of cse with specialization in ai and ml!!! ???? Plzz make videk
18969,Mam lg rha h jee aspirant thi🤣🤣🤣
18970,Bhai ye college me admissions ka comission lete hai CSE seat khali nhi hai aur other branch lhali hai inko seat bhar nai. Demand ka graph bhi nhi dikhai or supply bta rhi.
18971,Good evening sir <br>Sir my question is can diploma holders get admission in nit iiit DTU nsit through jee main in 1st year not lateral entry... <br>Please confirm
18972,Bhai ye college me admissions ka comission lete hai CSE seat khali nhi hai aur other branch lhali hai inko seat bhar nai. Demand ka graph bhi nhi dikhai or supply bta rhi.
18973,Good evening sir <br>Sir my question is can diploma holders get admission in nit iiit DTU nsit through jee main in 1st year not lateral entry... <br>Please confirm
18974,Pr Cs wale khud bhi kutch kr sakte h akele dusere wale nhi kr sakte
18975,"My verdict :<br>For proper confirmation::<br>&gt;Evaluate yourself first if you are better than 60- 80% of your classmates in coding , be it your computer coaching class or school .<br>&gt;Are you really interested in it ? <br>If you are , then you will definitely and often find something to code , be it some tool like in my case : polynomial eqn solver , little jarvis(whatever I did on my own) , some math game , etc)<br>&gt; Are you able to come up with solutions of programming questions atleast more than 50% of the time ?<br>&gt; If you have these qualities, then I think , you shouldn&#39;t think twice or worry about it, just go with it.<br><br>Note: It doesn&#39;t mean that if someone lacks in above point cannot do cse , he might become good in college .But what I mentioned is for them who have these aspects and want to be 100% sure"
18976,Thanks for your videos Kay lye
18977,Mam EE branch kaise h girls k liye
18978,Bhai ye college me admissions ka comission lete hai CSE seat khali nhi hai aur other branch lhali hai inko seat bhar nai. Demand ka graph bhi nhi dikhai or supply bta rhi.

18988,Maine toh arts liya h ❤️
18989,"Yeah coding is my passion !<br>I often build some interesting tools and programs out of my python knowledge.<br>I&#39;m 12th now , but literally I have never bought either class11 or 12th book."
18990,Achche bachche matlab rattu hey if someone is not good book but he is good at coding or love computer love digital world so what matter .... Community mat follow karo dil kehta hey vo karo baad mey man to lag jata hey umar k sath mehnati ho jate he

18996,It&#39;s the Truth which can be funny too and harsh even
18997,ಠ_ಠ
18998,"11th class student be like<br>Me: Dude what is your optional? <br>Him : fine arts, I have a lot of interest and passion in it<br>In last few days of 12th<br>Me : which engineering are you going to take? <br>Him : I have always like computers it is my passion. <br>The optional IP and CS and ME in our scl :👁👄👁"
18999,Nhi bey
19000,This is not  badia

19032,@23_Zain Mujawar yes cse best hai if you have interest then only warna pass hona e muskil ho jayega
19033,Batao bhai ye saal computer engineering lena sahi rehga?<br>Like aage jaake jab demand badhjayegi toh job problem nahi hoga fir?<br>Toh behtar hai ab lena ke nahi?
19034,Ha wahi students badh rha hai to... Companies bhi highest hai cse ka
19035,Mam agar 4-5 saal mei jyada computer science vaale ho jayenge te demand bhi toh badhni hai iski
19036,Yes...u should go for other field of your interest cause engineering is not good nowadays
19037,"@Nishant solanki engineering mein nahi interest toh jis cheez mein interest hai wo karo . Nursing/ medical field mein bahut scope hai aur, future mein artificial intelligence engineers ko replace kar dega, lekin medical professions ko nahin. So choose wisely 😊"

19052,Sahi bola bhai 😭😭😭😭
19053,Kara tuo kara kya 😢😢
19054,"I agree with you, it&#39;s not only in engineering but the same scenario is in every field... Moreover in a densely populated country like INDIA the demand for jobs are not fulfilled fully"
19055,"I can&#39;t understand 1 thing,<br>Whatever the scenario you all the discussing right now ,<br>The same creteria happened in every branch of engineering.<br>Infact when we are talking about EE,Civil ..etc the no.of student are high in these branch also .and the main point is do they have adequate amount of jobs for that huge group...!? <br><br>Agar problem itna hi hai them why it happened that a non cs/it guy also try to get a job in IT industry.<br><br>Less jobs problem is almost every where.<br>Ha &quot;a person should choose the field of its interest &quot;- I also support this point .<br>But for the rest of the part from placement to job . I think all branches have same scenario"

19117,So even though I’m a freshman CompSci major I should be applying for internships ?
19118,Damn I live in MOROCCO
19119,So if I want to code what course do I go for
19120,"Someone needs to tell me how to deal with the imposter syndrome, I am sophomore and I feel like quiting everytime I get a new assignment cause the anxiety is so bad, I&#39;ll literally cry myself to sleep, I always feel like I don&#39;t know what I am doing and that it&#39;s never enough! What should I do?"
19121,Man I am From Morocco 😂
19122,you look like sauron
19123,"i only just recently took up part time diploma, in computer system and network... and it&#39;s only been a week and could not keep up. Been always weak at maths and lived my life mostly not needing all the things happening in the course. I feel like i am just gonna get those little certs that google/IBM or whatever is offering to beef up my resume..."
19124,"It&#39;s afterall a good video with plenty of sincere suggestions, but I do recommend not wrapping up sponser ads with your real experience. It really undermines your genuity, although we all know it&#39;s just fabricated ad story."
19125,this is soo relatable
19126,Computer programming is being outsourced by US corporations. You could be managing others to do programming instead of doing the programming yourself.  I am not seeing too many programmers made it to 65.  It is not an age friendly occupation.
19127,"I&#39;m a 3rd year Junior High student, for now I&#39;m pretty interested in studying coding as a hobby, but i don&#39;t know jack shit about it. Will someone enlighten me?"
19128,one thing I&#39;m sure i know after studying CS its SO DAMN COMPLEX your literally a scientist!
19129,Loved this stroll down memory lane but I gotta go throw up now. 🤮🤣
19130,Everything you learn in school will become obsolete in 10 years; technology is changing fast.  It is a scary thought.
19131,"Thanks for the video man I&#39;m 2/3 done with my CS degree and I&#39;m still just feel really dumb with what I learned so far, I&#39;m not even sure what I&#39;m going to work as when I even graduate and just no idea what this course can do. Definitely a bit more confident about internships now because I was just scared of the expectations but this video helped me"
19132,Ever heard of internet trolls?<br><br>People with too much time or the very irresponsible ones?
19133,I am great 🧊🤤🥖🧬🕸️🍼🍼🍾🍾🥛🥛🍉🍉👙🤱🏻🍑🍡
19134,"in college, you&#39;ll have to do A LOT on your own<br>aim to understand and enjoy a topic. be patient<br>keep motivating yourself using realistic examples and chart a plan to better yourself<br>use office hours wisely. spend time with your doubts before you approach other with it<br>break big things into small chunks and work/study on a daily basis<br>start interning early"
19135,"Take another class with a different teacher.  if you are still struggling, then switch major.  Not everyone has the gift."
19136,"I just started aplied computer science course and I&#39;m already not sure if I&#39;m doing it right , I have trouble with setting everything up and everyone in my class is just doing everything easily while I&#39;m struggling with even the most basic stuff , do you got any tips that could help me study or focus better?"
19137,I think you’ll ruin what you enjoy by making your entire life a YouTube job. Not everything is meant to be shared as well as you needed a break so that you don’t get burnt out or stop enjoying what you do. IMO
19138,No way one of my professors made me watch this vid and write about it but I already watched this like last year😂
19139,I want to be a software developer but I&#39;m studying computer science. What&#39;s Ur advice?
19140,"Thank you so much for this educational video, I learned so much. <br>Such creative videos you’ve on this channel. Just subscribed!<br>Officially the first viewer of any video on this channel. <br>I’ve never witnessed such awesome editing as this one. <br>Just here to visit the video views. You, too?"
19141,I switched from Computer Science to Information Systems since it straight up destroyed any motivation I ever had for programming and the stress was killing me
19142,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=0m05s"">0:05</a> eyy that&#39;s my country, i did not expect hearing it literally in the first 10 seconds haha"
19143,I know I can trust this guy from his eyebags alone
19144,Thank you
19145,TBH I feel Like they think be Computer Science Students just need to be a Professional Google Searcher at the End !!!!    lololol
19146,"Mistakes to avoid<br>1. Not asking professors about what you don&#39;t understand ( even the stupidest questions ask them)<br>2. Not getting EARLY into internships<br>3. Procrastinationnnn, doing projects or assignments in the last min<br>4. Not doing enough research and work outside of lectures and classes ( in college your work hours &gt;&gt;&gt; classes work hours)<br>5.  Not doing enough works by yourself, other than what&#39;s required from you to do."
19147,morrocoooo &lt;3
19148,"Doesn&#39;t work for everyone, but the thing I&#39;ve done was learning to code and getting a job before staring the college."
19149,You can try freelancing for free and build a portfolio with this
19150,My problem is I can get all A’s but not be able to get internships because they require projects and crazy coding questions to be answered
19151,"My regret as a Computer SCience student. First I will never ever enrol on a Computer Science degree because it&#39;s just a waste of time. Everything now can be learned online. Computer Science is just a waste of time and money. Remember these billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk they are drop outs. LOL"

19170,I am Moroccan and i think that Morocco is a great place to travel
19171,I&#39;m Moroccan and welcome man 😊
19172,hlooo..what&#39;s your college name...and are you in 3rd year now....
19173,"@Brad S You can watch youtube tutorials if you want to learn other language, there&#39;s a lot of youtuber doing a full course video step by step and it&#39;s totally free since it&#39;s from youtube. Then just practice and practice. I also have digital modules which I bought online for only like 2-3$ and it&#39;s where I also get my other ideas for learning"
19174,What resources do you use when learning other languages besides the ones you&#39;re being taught in class?
19175,"I&#39;m a 2nd year college of CS right now. One of the things I do is learning other language at home or anywhere besides the language your University is mainly teaching you. My University teach Java and JavaScript, so I decided to learn C++ and C# as extra. RN it&#39;s really going well while learning 4 languages at the same time"
19176,"My classmates are super duper non procrastinators. We all rush to get to our home or library to work on our homework as soon as possible same day they are given. We literally move near the campus and every fucking second count we even find routes that get us from school to home asap!!! And most of us did excellent after college. One non procrastinator who likes to ask questions to the teachers and classmates can influence the whole group to look at the homework for example and before you know it, all are involved in the homework!!!! So kudos to non procrastinators and the nerds, the leader in the group. The catalyst for success!! Study well and take studies seriously. Think of your studies like real work. Not a playground to play and be imaginative, do that On your free time with your friends and classmates. Because education is that precious and once you miss the chance life has passed you by. And by life I mean opportunities that you will never even get to know if you just be like the rest of the average crowd. No scholarships, no travel and intercultural experiences, basically nothing just using the internet for information and knowledge but not really living the experience. Your credibility to speak about certain things are just that-words. And words don’t necessarily mean you are great at what your claim. There  are a gazillion students and professionals who do things better than you. Like my teacher said, don’t be fooled by stream media whatever that means…. Be original in your thoughts, in your calculations and support those scientists who have gone before you and laid the foundations of science. Anyway great video. Makes you learn to discern what makes a YouTube video excellent and worth your viewing time."
19177,"The people who can buy million dollar homes in my area are non procrastinators. There’s that group of people who know what to do and how to do the homework but cannot find the motivation to begin, and there’s the group who take too long to begin because they simply do not know how to do it. If you belong to the second, there’s hope for you. For the first, you can, like this guy do YouTube and you would not work on your videos in the long run. You won’t be able to produce as many videos that self-sustain. You need to post everyday for your channel to be known."
19178,"The joys of breezing through high school without studying much, I called it winging it. But you won’t get honors for that. Which means your parents have to pay for your college if you don’t get excellent grades, you will lose scholarship. Smart right? Not studying. Then you have to study in college. You land a great entry level job and you feel invincible earning well above the minimum but you have to make up for your deficit, the money you lost spent in your college by being lazy. And most tech companies don’t hire just average folks who don’t study since birth. <br><br>Then you start thinking I’m not fit for this job for the long haul so I’m going to be self-employed. I’m gonna be my own boss. Then suddenly making YouTube videos feels right. So off you go quit your day job and claim making  Youtube videos is a real job. The analytics is pretty laid out for you, heck you don’t even know how to program like hardcore. You just like saying you have a job. Then you realize self employment folks need to pay taxes otherwise you will be fined. Not cheap. And then you have a family, where you don’t have benefits making videos. How can you earn a million per ads and click? It’s like those bloggers who hyped blogging but in real life they don’t even help pay the bills. It’s good to just lie about what you do and hype it up. Eventually life will catch up on you. Life has passed you by.<br><br>Never ever slack on education since kindergarten. If you have drawing classes or drama/arts, do well in it. Just do it. They pay in the long run. Tom Hanks went to my local community college. He was great at theater drama etc so he became famous. It was a passion since birth not because they do not like to put in the hard work and use their chosen career as an escape to a dull life."

19200,Computer science is NOT pure programming... there&#39;s a lot of solid theory which frankly you will NEVER need outside of a classroom. Just keep that in mind.<br><br>Its kind of like physicists and engineers. A physicist will research and try and understand the theory while an engineer will apply it.

19214,I certainly recommend taking office hours. There was one semester where I took office hours almost two days a week and it helped me pass the class. Taking office hours also lets the professor know that you&#39;re really serious and studious about the class. I also recommend following tutorials on Youtube before and during the class so you can be more prepared and more knowledgeable on the subject. I&#39;ve done that many times and it really helped me with my college education.

19231,On point 1. You are definitely right to not treat college like highschool. Im in CC at 32 and I tell some of my classmates to do homework outside of class and treat it seriously. I also tell them that I&#39;m amazed that thy are able to hold a job and go to school at the same time.

19250,"My biggest regret is assuming my college will let it&#39;s student use their computer in order to do programming in blank time between their empty class session (in case they don&#39;t bring their laptop or their laptop broke or something else), and that the some other naive idealistic thought of what Programming lab practice would be in my mind that i definitely have forgotten due to bored mind."

Any advice is appreciated.
19291,"How did it go, what did you wish you had done before starting CS"
19292,Hello
19293,I didn&#39;t have any background on computer programming before I signed up to CS so I had a pretty hard time of adjusting to my course and a lot of procrastination happened even now. This video gave me time to think about myself and my goals as a computer science student. Thank you so much!
19294,"I really wanna do game programming but thinking about what you said about your expectations vs reality of your cs major, would I be better of majoring in a game development specific degree?"
19295,The first year of computer science completely fucking beat me. Finally got enough cash to continue my studies and imma do everything in my will to get this degree
19296,"as you said that you thought you’ll be doing the coding work and programming stuff , will software engineering as undergrad be able to help in that ? cause i’m looking to do the same and not really interested in theories of comp sci"

19302,Hi from morocco
19303,Hey if the computer thing does not work out you could always be a model
19304,fk yh
19305,"@lena lara hey Lena, that’s a great question! Before I started college I also didn’t have any knowledge or experience about CS or SE. Remember, in college you can always change your major. What I would recommend is choosing a school that has a large CS college so you have options of taking some programming classes for other majors. For instance, my school RIT has the college of computing and information sciences which has several majors including software engineering, CS, web and mobile, computing security, etc. For me, I was so fascinated with coding and problem solving and found out that majoring in SE provided many more courses for software architecture, practical knowledge such as “how to learn languages on the job”, and so much more. Also, many schools do not have a co-op program. RIT is one of the schools that does, and you don’t have to pay tuition while on co-op. I picked a school that has a good co-op program because the biggest difference between me and other recent graduates in my field is that I already have over a year of real experience as a software engineer. Sorry that was a long response, I’m really passionate about this."
19306,hey michael so  I dont have any prior knowledge about cooding or anything and i have always been interested in cs should i still choose cs. and do you have some advices that would help me.
19307,"I highly recommend getting into internships and co-ops too! I&#39;m in my 4th year in Software Engineering and my knowledge and experience have helped me figure out what I want to do with my career. I had an internship after my freshman year, working on web development, which really showed me that I wanted to look around at more jobs other than that one. My second internship was a co-op that lasted ~7 months full-time, where I worked with a physicist to write a python simulation. I enjoyed the work, but I wanted to keep looking. My third internship is another 7 month co-op where I&#39;m working on embedded software and I have learned so many different tools like web sockets, MQTT, and much more. Truly, internships and co-ops are a necessary and one of a kind experience."
19308,"Damn you caught me on the procrastination part of the video, going for cyber security and that’s my biggest problem."
19309,Lot of good advice in this video
19310,"Do the vlog integration, and organize topics within your created playlists for those topics"
19311,Literally 0 experience coding or anything with computers during hs. Can anyone tell me if this won&#39;t be for me at all? I feel like everybody already has a basic foundation that they started on
19312,"I&#39;m 54. Lack a bit more than a semester for mechanical engineering degree... 30 years ago... You were definitely the teacher in this video. I&#39;m brand new to front end web development through a public/private partnership... At the moment learning HTML and CSS. Scared. Confused.. but eager to learn this. I see parallels between this and calculus in the problem solving aspect... Not that I could solve a very basic calculus problem at this time. Not happening. But I remember the thrill of working through literally five pages of computation, making sure to record each step (this was with paper and pencil... And eraser) and end the end... Getting the wrong solution.  But still happy that I actually got there, knowing my process was right just made an error or two along the way... Sounds like coding. But I digress... Your video and other videos are engaging,thoughtful and on point. Im watching &quot;how to think like a programmer&quot; videos tonight instead of &quot;how to&quot; for a break. And this has been a nice, uplifting detour."

19320,Wow I had a completely different highschool and college experience. In highschool I half assed things too but in college I didn’t even show up to finals and passed classes I didn’t even crack open a text book except for if I had to in class
19321,from Morroco dude
19322,welcome to Morocco . mybe I&#39;m the first Moroccan watching this video . hahah
19323,How is college in India? I am supposed to do college in india and honestly im scared
19324,"Well, that&#39;s not how college works in india 🥴"
19325,I feel like internship has gotten so much more competitive now with computer science. They pretty much expect you to be fluent at at least one or two languages and understand data structures really well. I’m still struggling to get an internship and I’m a sophomore now.
19326,What is the best way to contact you about a product endorsement?
19327,"So, I&#39;m a veteran, 38 years old.. sheetmetal mechanic on fighter jets. I want to change careers. Thinking of attending ODU for software engineering.  Is this something I can do? Is it worth it? What&#39;s the starting pay?"
19328,"Lol, im from morocco and I don&#39;t know how, but I expected you would say morocco 😂😂😂😂❤"
19329,Can you be a top programmer through self study??
19330,Jeez just get to the point
19331,Where&#39;s the AngelList link?
19332,"I did all those mistakes to be honest. But how did you bounce back and get yourself out of the whale&#39;s gut? O_o <br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freshgradbutimkindafuc"">#FreshGradButImKindaFuc</a>*ed"
19333,"I personally never did Uni, and works. causing me to have 4 / 5 years of work experience after uni ends. Who would a company choose? =D"
19334,Crazy I’m in Morocco and this is the first time watching your video raised in Minnesota lol
19335,Will all the subjects of computer science be credited if I shift to Computer Engineering?  Like being a regular student?
19336,I&#39;m a programmer and before that I was in premed I figured if I can get into premed I can do IT. Already been over 10 years since I got into the field 😗🎶 stackoverflow is your friend 😝 any oldies here remember xanga or angel fire? 🤣
19337,Bro  los cursos que distes coursess algunos nos osn validos en frreee😪
19338,I just klicked on this video to write this comment twlling you how much you look like a twat on this thumbnail !
19339,that shirt is so cool i can&#39;t find out what it is anywhere ?!
19340,Hahahah welcome to Morocco
19341,Not trying to be be mean as all but I like to speed up by 1.75x to save alot of time<br>It was good video
19342,First seed gather five elements  then bacteria makes roots then stem then leaf then flower then fruit then seeds
19343,While biology comes from coding bro
19344,2 years since video got out
19345,y tf are u so relatable 😭😭😭😭
19346,I realized all of this my first semester of college 👏🏽 your wisdom will help prepare a lot of people
19347,then quit being a computer science fella. this video is trash. quit and do something else then....  B!  You are not motivating youngster who wanna be.
19348,You’re cute
19349,i wish i were listening to this before two years🙂💔.
19350,Lol when you just stumbled across this video but you&#39;re actually from Morocco you know you&#39;re in the right place
19351,What a handsome young man.
19352,Lame reasons bro
19353,Me: I wanna code so i can make attacks for a game
19354,By GOD please have kids! Those perfect teeth of yours NEED to be passed on. Good GOD!
19355,Those are very common terms
19356,"@ForrestKnight .Have you by any chance done the &quot;Learning how to learn&quot; course on Coursera by Barbara Oakley? -imposter syndrome,-Rubber ducky... These sound familiar as heck."
19357,Bro you look like  Matthew Mcconaughey lol :D
19358,Does he say software... or sulfur? 🤣
19359,justin bieber??
19360,Shoot if the guys look like this I’m class I’ll major on it 😌 JK GUYS LOLOL ...... 😳
19361,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=2m23s"">2:23</a> is it possible to learn such a power?"
19362,this opened my eyes
19363,Ah yes 2020.. the year where school became online and assignments were now taking 8 hours long or more. Its prepared me for that part atleast.
19364,Computer Science is an interesting degree to me but NOT Coding. I don’t want a job that involves coding in it!
19365,I hope I didn’t make a mistake by choosing to commit myself to this degree 🤦🏽‍♂️
19366,"Me, doing a humanities degree: hmm yes advice"
19367,"It&#39;s weird how I just clicked on the video and you guessed my country, I think imma go for computer science"
19368,This video is a complete waste of my time. It&#39;s common sense. I was expecting more around learning tips.
19369,I am from Morocco weird
19370,currently procrastinating kusa
19371,Which course is better to become a software developer: INFORMATION SYSTEM or COMPUTER SCIENCE? I&#39;ve heard that as a Developer you spend more time analyzing than coding?
19372,"who is from Morocco or leave there at least, come here !"
19373,"Bro, the first one is SO TRUE<br>In high school I used to study one day before and get high grades, but in college at first I kept that mentality and I failed some subjects and had some overall bad grades. It took me a while to adapt and honestly I havent really adapted 100% yet but it is wayy better already lol"
19374,"I wish Brazil was as relaxed in class hours as the US seems to be, here it&#39;s like 5~6 hours of classes a day and then the rest of the day you study on your own if you can squeeze in the time for all the courses you&#39;re taking<br><br>Self-directed study is much more effective to actually learning shit than just sitting at a class and being lucky if you can pay attention"
19375,im thinking what i will take cs or ce 🤔
19376,Nice strategy I must say. I didn&#39;t earn as<br> Much as this video claim but I earn about 3250USD every week and I don&#39;t do that using video
19377,do a different channel!
19378,Good channel from Morocco
19379,Thank god you are just a student and not doing a job
19380,Thanks for this vid really takes alot of stress off my shoulders
19381,"Funny cuz my pops wanted me to go into cpu science. Its not that I didnt want to, its just I saw that Calc II, Linear Algebra, &amp; 2 calculated Physics classes that told me nahhh kid I&#39;m good cuz I hated Math. But I self taught myself how to code, feel like I can get a job as a Software, ios, Android, or full stack developer anywhere lol... now or days theres coding bootcamps &amp; ppl can learn on YouTube about coding languages if they wanna get into software or web development. I learned that my radio/tv/film degree coupled with coding skills would make me unstoppable. Shit i can create my own platform🤷🏾‍♂️"
19382,Hi is there a future for a BS CS graduate from other countries like the Philippines to work in the United States?
19383,damnn im a double major... Music and CS LOL yeah i have no life at all...
19384,Your look like Jesus
19385,"First semester, 50 students<br><br>Second, 20 students<br><br>Third, 5 students (I flunked this class). COVID cut many assignments so I had no hope in passing the class (even with a 90% final)<br><br>Fourth, unknown because I failed the third class"
19386,The IT biz is basically a series of temp jobs. Tech is a dead end career for 95% of people. I worked in IT for 15 years - hated almost every second of it. I stock shelves in a grocery store now. The thought of going on another IT job interview sends shivers down my spine.
19387,Thanks for the positive advice about internships!😎
19388,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> Same. Haha I thought I would be focusing on coding."
19389,Your american accent is kind of familiar. It reminds of some actor... where are you from
19390,*Laughs in Asian
19391,Oh yeah that procrastinating part is cute
19392,Hello from Morocco - Africa
19393,"Umm, where&#39;s the angel list link?"
19394,"JESUS, I found u!!"
19395,my biggest regret being a computer science student is that I am one of those.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>just kidding i love CS
19396,its my 1st year in highschool rn and can yall help? Wut subjects do you recommend for 11th grade?
19397,You look like Justin Bieber.
19398,I feel so lucky uni in my country is free u just have to pass the hardest test you will ever give. But it’s free
19399,"I always hear that highschool was easy. What the hell highschool did you go to because my highschool was intense. TONS of homework, AP classes were SERIOUS work and lack of sleep was real. Even the top academic kids suffered from burnout, depression. That&#39;s not even mentioning sports and extracurriculars, and many of us also worked part time. University was was like summer camp with tons of free time compared to highschool. In fact that&#39;s one of the reasons I had trouble in college: I wasn&#39;t used to managing free time and self motivation because I simply had never had that option before."
19400,"&quot;Maybe you have 1 to 2h of homework at home&quot; hahahah in Romania you get at least 5 hours of homework and extra study daily, depending on how hard you try. I was doing a math/computer programming profile highschool. It&#39;s interesting to see the differences between countries."
19401,"That is what I hated the most about getting a cs degree, 99% everything else, except programming. I asked the university why there were so many unrelated classes and they said it was to weed out students. So the nightmare of chemistry and physics series was just to see who can endure more torture."
19402,"I wish I went your high school, what with no homework. College was a lot more laid back for me."
19403,These tips are legit! I definitely wish I used my office hours more.
19404,"I think that your description, while accurate for my experience, I felt very differently than you did, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong. For example, you said that there was more homework and less class time. That was true, but I never once had the word &quot;homework&quot; come to mind. I was going to be coding anyway, and whatever they gave me always had that spoonful of sugar. My B.S. was in Computer Engineering, and after that, I switched to Computer Science for an M.S. degree. I took 1 day of the semester long transition classes, and told them that this would be a waste of time and money, and they let me register for master level classes, but I could only continue that way if I passed the finals for the transition courses, which I did. I&#39;m not sure that I ever wanted to be in high school because I wanted to be home wiring things together and coding. I wanted to be in college because, after the 1st 2 years, which I found more fun than high school even though they weren&#39;t &quot;major&quot; classes (I got an A.S. in math in those 2 years), I was wiring and coding all the time. Maybe I couldn&#39;t choose what the projects are, but I could choose how to solve them. My main problem was eating: money was tight."
19405,"A professional trainer with an Instagram account: (anderlord_hack) provides training programs in the field of hacking, software engineering, web development, cybersecurity, digital marketing ... etc. He can help you unblock, enable and restore Facebook and Instagram accounts. Do not waste the opportunity, it may change your life to get the job of your dreams.."
19406,"I always think about going for an internship, but I never look further into it because I always think that I need to have all this programming knowledge to start my internship. lol, the Forrest for clearing that up for me."
19407,"Ayo Forrest, wtf was the &quot;buh, buh, buh&quot; u did at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=3m59s"">3:59</a> hahahaha"
19408,Thanks man
19409,"The single most important thing I learned in five years of university is perseverance. After breezing through high school it&#39;s easy to think things will just come to you with little effort. The really meaningful challenges take a lot of work and patience to get solved, and are a lot more rewarding for it."
19410,The first point you made about how you can&#39;t just do a &quot;worksheet&quot; for programming is something I&#39;ve realized pretty late in my college career as well.
19411,Why does your accent sound like a cross between L.A. and New Orleans? Reminds me a little of Matthew McConaughey.
19412,Hi I do electrical and electronics at university. Technically I do software engineering 😎
19413,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=3m53s"">3:53</a> Trump is here"
19414,"When you say ‘theory’, what exactly do you mean? Like, algorithms or something else?"
19415,NO REGERTS
19416,"Guys I have question. I’m second year CS student  , I started this course because it was my elder brother’s idea , mih all I wanted was a course of math coz I perform well in math and math is my favorite subject. Bt now I have some problems with computer science especially the tech parts so what should I do. Give me advice should I quit and look for another math course coz CS we will do math only the first two years and the remaining years is only softwares of which is theories."
19417,"Its funny you can be the biggest expert or gain all kinds of knowledge from research, videos, YouTube, Google, ect. But at the end of the day whether you have a small little stat on a paper that says Bachelors Degree for Computer Science is all that matters for someone to be taken seriously 😀👍"
19418,I m correctly doing my Computer Science College and I agree with things you said
19419,You look like Justine Bieber
19420,"Take it from a recovering procrastinator, don’t do it. You’re doing yourself a disservice once you become an adult, you essentially become a liability to your own success."
19421,"I have a freaking huge question. I would be thankful if you could give me some advice. So, when u register as college 👨‍🎓 student and the career. What do you do first, do you just constantly choose the career u want in college and stay there for 8 or whatever hours a day or they give u various classes that doesn’t have anything to do with programming."
19422,you look like Justin Bieber
19423,John B 2.0
19424,HS I had 4-6 hours of homework... the heck you talkin&#39; about xD
19425,Do you know any places where i can get internships
19426,I&#39;m failing highschool and i probably will. do i still get a chance on computer science if i started investing about it since highschool?
19427,Shoutout from Morocco North Africa 🇲🇦
19428,I&#39;m Moroccan 😂
19429,"Oh thank you so much for explaining that thing about the difference between CS and zogtware developpement, I was about to apply to CS meanwhile what I want is software developpement, thank you so much"
19430,I feel like the professor would get mad at me for asking a question lol
19431,"So if someone is trying to pursue a software development job, what major should they major in then?"
19432,Put everything in one channel so everyone can find you in one channel
19433,How is your boat building going
19434,"May i ask what if one do if someone have a master degree but still unemployed for that particular working sector, but he cannot turn back to the starting point because he has already overqualified and job skills mismatch for another field&#39;s starting position. What should he do please?"
19435,He looks like the henchmen from Far Cry 5 LOL
19436,Ty!
19437,Did he say OTU?
19438,You look like someone in GTA5.
19439,"100% true, 100% in my junior year in pain, 100% still procrastinating"
19440,Thank you for the valuable advice! I was expecting more details about the CS degree but I’m satisfied hahaha
19441,hloo...what are you doing now...do you get job??
19442,"I felt that. Mostly the procrastinating. It is still a problem which is hard to fight. <br>I wish I would have asked more questions, but I didn&#39;t dare to. <br>I wish I would have worked less while being a student. I worked every weekend in my first semester and that screwed me over very very much.<br>I wish I would have taken the math-pre-course offered by other students since I suffered in maths a lot. (Also the tutor looking down on us and going &quot;this is trivial&quot; was not helping. should have changed the tutorium. honestly.)<br>I wish I would have spend more time studying instead of gaming. That was a huge problem back then. <br>I wish I would have made the effort to get to know more different people rather than trying to stick to the ones I knew. It was all rather toxic and brought me down. <br><br>Now on a positive note: I found a student job by pure luck in a research group at the university farily early. Still working there to this day and it is one of the best things that ever happened to me. I wish I would have used these ressources more when I was younger, but i&#39;m trying to better myself now. :)"
19443,Dude looks like Jesus !!
19444,@TA93 google and YouTube university lol + books
19445,how did u do that?
19446,I went to ODU ... Dropped CS major after 1 semester self-taught was easier then those crowded lectures 😅
19447,There should be information security degrees that should put you on the right path towards cyber security. Im pretty sure you can get into cyber with cs degree
19448,"I&#39;m really interested in cyber security but idk how I should start with it. My original play is finishing CS degree after that I get into cyber security master&#39;s. I&#39;m not pretty sure if it works, so if anyone has an idea please leave me a comment!"
19449,"I&#39;m planning to study CS, but after reading the comment section, I kinda understood that CS doesn&#39;t have that much programming. Although I wanted to study it so I can write codes. What do you think guys?"
19450,Anyone know any free software to where I can code Java/Android studios by chance ? I was on IntelliJ but my subscription is up ...Any resources / recommendations is greatly appreciated/ thank you
19451,@Lowkey Loki I rented a textbook and if it doesn&#39;t stick I&#39;ll know not to get a loan out.
19452,"I&#39;ve been thinking about CS, but a lot of videos have me thinking all I really want is to learn java, unity, and adobe, and I probably don&#39;t need all the CS theory, even though it sounds interesting."
19453,Wow I really needed this 😢. Thank You! @ForrestKnight
19454,How old is too old to start coding if someone has never coded before?
19455,Your thumbnail looks like a painting

19463,"It&#39;s not too late, I&#39;m 31 and in my second semester, just make sure you feel like you can understand advanced math and problem solving. One of my professors got his doctorate in his 50&#39;s, it&#39;s never too late!"
19464,"can you please tell me,  is it too late to star computer science with 32 year old like me ?"
19465,"Video starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=2m05s"">2:05</a>"
19466,I just started my first semester and I see all these amazing coders and I just can’t see myself being even close to them
19467,same problem...presentation is the worst nightmare all the time...i don&#39;t know how to get rid from this...
19468,"To be honest, I was one of most introverted kid in high school, and thought to myself, I’ll never overcome the fear of social communication. However, after high school, I attended CÉGEP (thing in Québec, Canada lol), and I knew that I would know practically no one there. I decided to either fear and relive my nightmares from high school, or prepare and improve myself to face my out of comfort zone. I chose the latter, and never in my entire life did I ever regret spending a lot of time to gain and master tricks to stay relaxed and focused on the present moments. Those empowering moments to myself really did actually help me gain confidence over the long term! Sure I didn’t get too comfortable at first when establishing new social interactions, but after I did, things just went smoothly from there. Today, I am still very glad that I decided to face my fear with personal improvement for months, and am very proud to be less shy/timid than before. <br><br><br>TIPS: What I did: listen to any sounds before any or even during a conversation to stay focused on the present moment. You can even concentrate on how your body feels on that moment (feel standing, clothes wrapping, etc.), the point is, you have to start by being in the present moment and try to silence the voice in your head that yells that everything will go wrong. <br>Then, as I stammered a lot during conversations, after I got focused on the present moment, I then focused on my tongue and mouth. As this times we’re behind masks, really articulating and feeling your tongue is not even easier, but it helps a lot for me too!<br>Finally, the main trick that I used to help me relax before any presentation or social conversations is the main UNIVERSAL idea: you have the right to be anxious (helps a lot to embrace your anxiety, and using the tricks above, you can easily talk in any kinds of situations!<br><br>Really hope this helps"
19469,"@Hamza Dahmani Practice, and sometimes people overthink too much and stress themselves out. I used to be horrible at speeches/presenting in front of the class but overtime I gained confidence and honestly had fun with it."
19470,"you have no idea how much i feel you , that is probably my top 3 fears ever for some reason"
19471,Believe it or not sometimes being angry at anything helps me gain confidence.
19472,The thing I fear the most is Presenting In front of class.... I’d rather run 10 miles than present
19473,"honestly, from what I&#39;ve heard, they expect you to know nothing . Even in interviews, all they want to know is how you problem solve"
19474,Starting my first internship today and the people at the office told me I&#39;m probably gonna spend time making coffee hahahahaha
19475,@Hannah Z Thankyou so much for your suggestion!
19476,"@Ayu Putri Dewi Fitriyani do you need the 4.00 gpa or can you handle doing the organization and getting a 3.00-3.50? If it takes too much time and you can’t study, ditch the organization. If you can handle doing both but you won’t be able to get a perfect 4.00, then keep it since your resume will look better with the organization on it than if you only have a 4.00 gpa."
19477,"hey guys so the highest GPA in my country is 4.00 and my GPA in the first year was less than 3.00 and have to repeat 2 classes, maybe that&#39;s because I have some organization &amp; event at that time. If u were me, what u should do in next semester? Focus on academic until ur GPA is more than 3,50 or still working on organization while study? Thankyou"
19478,"I think that’s what I’m most afraid of – getting internships early. I’m currently a freshman in college majoring in CS, and I have little to no knowledge about coding. So, when I try to apply for internships, I’m afraid that these jobs that an intern does will involve hacking Amazon’s database or something wild."
19479,Where do u study?
19480,During vacation?
19481,how.the.fuck. do you have time for an internship lmao.
19482,2021st comment 😼

19489,"I didn&#39;t know what I was getting into, and regret it now 😞"
19490,I&#39;m taking computer science and I&#39;m just on the edge. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll pass the final for this class
19491,you look like cobain on the thumbnail
19492,If you love coding choose software engineering
19493,I am confused about choosing computer science or software engineering 😩😕<br><br>What should I choose??!
19494,I dropped out of engineering to start CS ;w;
19495,My regret is not dropping out sooner so I can actually do something useful and start my career.
19496,preach brother. I had the same high school mentality which leads to my only regret. <br>My only regret was thinking how smart I was in High-School just because my mother wouldn&#39;t have to tell me to complete my hw because I was a nerd like that. And I would think just cause I was in advanced classes and would get my hw done on time w/o anyone telling me to and passing classes I thought I was smart enough and knew it all lol.  <br>But once I got into college to seek a CS degree I quickly realized how lost I was at math and the rest of the sciences. Thanks for sharing. <br>Wise person once told me &quot;Giving up is not an option.&quot;

19502,Oh- thank you for letting me know about office hours
19503,Get Internship early: my semester couch planned to get one this year under Covid pandemic... Kinda bad
19504,i wanna become a software engineer but i do somewhat of a coding thing but not that good at so i wanna know what do i got to work at and to major on the its only computer science ?
19505,"lol, u can become a model"
19506,his school: 1-2 hours hw a day<br>mine: 1-2 hours a month
19507,I love software engineer . But should I study computer science ?
19508,I&#39;m sitting here relating to everything you did wrong and it&#39;s motivating me to fix it. haha
19509,Thanks for your advices man they&#39;re so much precious to me
19510,I am looking into this job because I’ve heard you have an opportunity to have some time to work on other ambitions

19512,"This was recommended for me,  I thought it was justin beiber  dude 😂😂😂"
19513,I thought I was watching a video of Justin Bieber talking about his regrets as a computer science student
19514,"2 weeks for a assignment? i think am in a wrong business in here, i gotta do 2 assignments in a week and the worst thing is that am still trying to figure out what my professor has presented 2 weeks ago.  My task was to disassemble picture in 2^x Quadtrees, using streams is kind a hard way, using arrays is more easier and i don&#39;t even know how to work with double arrays and can u imagine god damn miserable my life is now. how can i learn java in just 3 months when people take years to learn it.<br>I respect you. You came a long way, but there is not even a slightest bit of  inspiration in me to carry on, i can&#39;t even learn anything anymore because all this stress from what u mentioned about expectations of computer science and reality and being frighted to fail the class did really sucked out every motivation from me. worrying about next thing when cant even understand the last one  just piles up and there is nothing really to do because the give you very short amount of time.<br>And at the end thank u, its a great video and i can hardly relate to  your past cause am a first year student of computer science."
19515,maybe he should have travelled when he could

19531,Is the work ur doing in anyway smiler to what you learned in college
19532,Nothing has changed in the past 20 years....  Same then... Same now.
19533,"Man, im a sophmore CS student rn and i cant tall you how much you described my life in college. I think the best one is the office hours one because i didn’t use it at all my first whole year and im finding myself needing it way more this semester(it’s too late finals are literally in a few days). But if i pass this semester🤞🤞ill definitely be using office hours way more next semester and im gonna try and be a better student. Thank you, that was an awesome and very relatable video!"
19534,Where can I find internships
19535,"i&#39;m an experienced engineer and the thing i see young people miss the most is understanding how to solicit expectations from their boss so that they can meet them. everyone expects something different from people, so you can&#39;t just do what you think is best, you have to do what your boss things is the best thing to do (while mixing in some of your own initiatives and persuasions of course)."
19536,I regret doing my internship now
19537,He is describing high school right now
19538,I&#39;m in 3rd year and I&#39;m just laughing bc I&#39;ve been daydreaming without any hardwork. Thanks lol

I would also like if u suggest me some CSE books or their online PDF downloads."
19557,I regret not taking computer science. Taking software dev courses did not benefit me as much.
19558,Alright alright alright
19559,Thanks for the valuable advices.

19561,i know a video is a little old but thanks for help
19562,Starting my first year of college next year as a CS major wish me luck!
19563,Ah yes. One of my biggest regret is not getting into any internship early..
19564,Learning CS is like being thrown into a pool before you even how to swim. It’s 90% seft taught 😔

19573,Do software engineer jobs want CS graduates?
19574,I also interested in software engineering 😭
19575,"I’m currently a junior going for my bachelor in physics but I took so many electives already that I have a lot of free spots left to do whatever I want, I could even graduate early but Recently I have been thinking about getting a bachelor in CS after physics and if I start taking CS classes now, that CS bachelor could shrink down to a 2 year bachelor, or 5 classes per semester which is how much I alway have. My only concern is how hard CS is relative to physics, I mean in terms of ridiculousness nothing beats physics, I start with 3 constants and end up with a complex equation of absolute garbage. But I think CS is more like psychology class, a lot of talking and eventually some coding, while physics is all math and you might have like 3 words somewhere on the board."
19576,@iam j how much hours do you study a day?
19577,CS is more practical than theoretical either way. I believe that you should rather practice what you learn in class at home that way you&#39;ll KNOW what it means in theory since you&#39;ve seen it and you&#39;ll also have the knowledge to do it
19578,"@iam j hey guys so the highest GPA in my country is 4.00 and my GPA in the first year was less than 3.00 and have to repeat 2 classes, maybe that&#39;s because I have some organization &amp; event at that time. If u were me, what u should do in next semester? Focus on academic until ur GPA is more than 3,50 or still working on organization while study? Thankyou"

19581,"Right, when I got into my first CS class in college I was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages, but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in C++ for two days, and never did any other programming.<br><br>That first CS class made me hate CS. Because the material was way too quick. I started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph, and then it got too overwhelming since I was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week. I didn’t have enough time so I stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because I was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses. I understood how they worked, but not at all their applications.<br><br>My advice: read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word, so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together."
19582,"hmm, you&#39;re like my big brother."
19583,im starting my CS degree spring 2021.. nervous asf :(
19584,Btw morocco is great :3
19585,"A computer science degree nowadays is almost as worthless as a degree in philosophy, their are IV league courses and tutorials online for anyone getting into coding that can easily get you a junior developer job within 6-12 months of study, the fact someone is stupid enough to piss away over hundred grand and 5 years of their life on a shitty overpriced formal education should say enough."
19586,Fun fact about me. I procrastinate in every class except my CS classes. I start working on all of assignments and HW since I saw it on Canvas.
19587,Have I mey that this guy is reminiscing of Jesus Christ 😅
19588,You are so different from the typical computer science students I’m surrounded with🙁
19589,My biggest regret is actually choosing computer science  😢😢
19590,he cute
19591,My only regret as a student was my lack of understanding in Linux terminal. I learned programming but environment and debugging. That&#39;s a real deal at the end in undergrad years.
19592,"I&#39;m definitely pretty blessed to have my college covered by scholarships, because honestly I just don&#39;t think the debt is worth it. I&#39;m about to head into my junior year and my college requires you get an internship for your last year there."

19598,"Just started university(in UK) as as Comp Sci student. People in our course(we have around 350 ish) are complaining on the work and it seems like they didn&#39;t really research that Comp Sci is different from just Software Development/Computer Programming and if you&#39;re thinking of getting into just coding, Comp Sci(as he said) includes a lot of theory, especially mathematics and networks, etc."

19604,This is some solid advice.
19605,how about my regrets as a human being
19606,Jesus you suppose to have more subscribers.
19607,The thumbnail is so messed up
19608,"i study computer science in foreign language(english), also studying online when you  are first year is very chalenging. i don&#39;t even like CS, but i&#39;m not into other things either. it feels like i&#39;m wasting time."
19609,"The computer science field is so full of gatekeepers lol. If you want to major in computer science, just do it. Its about as hard as any engineering major. You dont have to be super passionate about coding or be a coding prodigy by 13. If you dont like math, dont work at a company involving physics or machine learning software. Instead of trying to keep the job market less competitive and stroking your ego by gatekeeping, why not just be better at your job."

19611,Is it 8-7 hours daily or over a week
19612,"Hi, is there a future for a BS CS graduate from other countries like the Philippines to work in the United States?"
19613,Honestly my undergrad was easy as hell. However my masters degree is basically this. They give roughly 30 min of lecture per week. You end spending somewhere between 8-12 hours doing your homework. <br><br>Even when they review the solutions. They only tell you the &#39;what&#39;. Never tell you &#39;why&#39; they chose that specific way of solving the problem. <br><br>Stack overflow is your friend.
19614,@Yakultgif front end development is now a choice i&#39;m going to consider. Thanks for the advice!
19615,"Yeah dude dont let people gate keep you from majoring in computer science. Different jobs, like front end developer, back end developer, data scientist, sysadmin, DevOps, SRE, Cloud architect, etc, are all covered by computer science. Its not just one homogeneous field that you will either love or hate.<br><br>You dont like math? Dont work in machine learning or cryptography. You want to be more creative and create visuals? Do front end development. You want be a pioneer of technology? Work in research and development. Research jobs, then ask yourself which one fits you the most. <br><br>Also, no you dont have to be super passionate in computer science. Plenty of people do their job just for a living and they are satisfied."
19616,"im going into the military, hopefully Air force, in about a year or two and im thinking when i go to college, i should do something like computer science but im seeing a-lot of comments saying you have to have a passion for it. I enjoy using computers but will i enjoy solving problems for computers? I have no clue but ill try the major out at least. Before making the decision to go into computer science so i could be a software engineer in the future, i wanted to be an anesthesiologist......ima huge dreamer. Both require long hours of work and i feel up for it but i rather not see people in surgery so i chose to be a software developer and realized that i may need to major in computer science. Comments won&#39;t discourage me, ill try it out for myself and see if it&#39;s the perfect fit for me."
19617,I passed my college and feel like I didn&#39;t learn anything from there <br>I could&#39;ve learned a lot on my own in that time
19618,"Yeah in high school i also very rarely studied at home and pass okay.<br>And in high school, I always hated this 1 guy that studied school subject almost 24/7.<br>I saw him as a dumbass and an idiot"
19619,Lol why?
19620,My regret as Computer Science Student?<br>Me: &quot;Always has been.&quot;
19621,"I chose CS and the funny thing is that the course called “introduction to computer science” scares the shit out of me 😂. It seems so random and abstract, one day we learn how to convert decimal into binary, another day we learn about sets and relations and the next day we learn haskell. The professor covers only the surface of what we are supposed to know for homework in that 45 min online session... guess i’ll have to study it on my own"
19622,"We have college for 7-8 hours a day somedays more and still, nothing gets done"
19623,In high school I didn&#39;t even do class work
19624,"It&#39;s like you think you are going to study the history of Texas, and they teach you the history of the world.<br>Computer science is a very general degree where you can work in every single IT job with that diploma."

19628,Thanks man
19629,Why am I seeing this after working on coding hw and regretting life😭😭
19630,My advice ? Get into an easier major and learn CS online for free. I am learning Data Science and doing an Internship without being a CS major 😄
19631,"bruh... I kive in Morocco, Africa wtf"

19633,I had the same thank you so much I am still in the college and that video helped me
19634,"Can’t agree enough with the office hours/ta point. I stayed up for hours trying to fix a bug and then I fixed the next morning after speaking with my prof for 10 mins. For the most part, they really want to help you and are usually much better explaining 1 on 1 than in a lecture"
19635,I&#39;m in high school and in my last year and this helps a lot because I&#39;ve been nervous about college but this give me more confidence and I&#39;ll make sure to write this down
19636,you make me nervous
19637,In India we go 7-8 hours for wasting time and then spend 7-8 hours for understanding the topics we &#39;tought&#39; in college . <br>Traveling 2 hours everyday is a different thing🌝
19638,I wish I played LESS Doom in my university&#39;s labs and did MORE ADA and C++ programming. I would have graduated in 1999 with a higher grade.

19641,"Tbh that is the exciting part about this field imo. You never stop learning. I&#39;m a huge nerd so while this may be annoying at some point, the self fulfillment for learning is amazing"
19642,@Siddhant Patil when did the comment talk about being homeless? All he did is talk about computer science being rough in a relationship
19643,@Saif Khan I know
19644,@Siddhant Patil im not replying to you  im replying to the original comment
19645,@Saif Khan  What do you mean? So if you are homeless but are married then your life isn&#39;t rough? You make no sense.
19646,"One of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they’re gonna pursue any IT jobs or anything related to CS is that it never ends. You’ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest CompTIA cert or if your current if good enough. It’s a rough life especially if you’re married or in a relationship, it’s just constantly hours in front of the screen."
19647,Use Professor&#39;s and TA&#39;s office hours!
19648,&quot;In college you go for 1-2 hours of classes a day and 7-8 hours of HW at home.&quot;<br><br>I have classes 8-5 every single day as a CS student.

19661,"Watching this while in my final year and woking on my research project. I won&#39;t lie for most of the time, I was slowly regretting doing computer science. Lord knows I have cried, struggled but also I managed to pull through. Took me a long while to find a focus I really did enjoy and that was just a few months ago. Now I&#39;m trying to do as much project and learn more in this field ."
19662,watching this right before starting college meant a lot to me... thank you
19663,"I&#39;m a first year CS student and honestly applying for internships rn is scary because I have no clue what they expect from me, but it&#39;s nice to know that they aren&#39;t always just expecting a master coder from first years."

19669,"@Punchy Now I have, found something I&#39;m really interested in. Thinking of studying architecture."
19670,"I went into the field because I wanted to make a lot of money. <br>Long story short, found out coding wasn&#39;t for me. I was literally stressing out and I gave up and dropped out. I guess I just didn&#39;t have a true passion for it. <br><br>I learned my lesson."
19671,lol u remind me of PewDiePie... :D is it just me?
19672,"Damn, I think I had the wrong high school and am in a wrong college rn. Both school and college, I spend/spent around 6 hrs a day in class AND 6 hrs at home doing homework 😂"
19673,What is it with americans and having so much homework? I don’t get it. In my university the only mandatory part of a course is the exam.
19674,"If you see that your professor seems a bit dumb in terms of teaching methods,start reading the stuff he/she is teaching from the internet<br>i am in my 2nd year as a computer science student, my professor  has 4 researches named after her and 3 cyber security degrees and obviously a phd and a master degrees, she  cannot teach, cannot pronounce words very well, depends on study materials from another professor to teach students aaaaand has been teaching for about 30 years, And the things im learning, literally took me 5 mins to learn the libraries and the inputs and alot of stuff for c program that took her about a month to teach and in the most shallow way possible to teach,she didn&#39;t tell us like hey, clrscr() can be summoned by the library conio.h or something like that, basically i went to my college just because when i get to graduate, i will have 5 degrees and it will add up to my resume:3"

19689,Im not a computer science major but I started working on my Web Development Certification. It helps that I&#39;ve been a web designer for 3 years already. All these tips are super helpful though.
19690,what a coincidence im from morroco welcome brooo my country its yours
19691,This guy looks like Jonas from Dark TV Show.
19692,How tf did youtube recommended this and knew that im a computer scinece student and didnt search anything related
19693,You insulte Me 😂

19703,you didn&#39;t have HW in high schools? bruh what kind of hell I grew up in
19704,"Man i&#39;m on my second year and almost cried when you said that you used to look at angelus for motivation i just did something like that, i feel more motivated just by hearing that, thanks man"
19705,Thanks for the video Forrest Knight I&#39;m 16 and I&#39;m currently in 10th Grade at my school these are the subjects I&#39;m doing <br><b>Information Technology</b><br><b>Physics</b><br><b>Geography</b><br><b>Maths</b> <br><b>English</b> <br>I want to study computer science in university but I&#39;m not sure what marks I should be getting and how to apply and which subjects should I be doing in highschool to sign up for computer scrience in university.<br>If anyone could guide me or give me some advice illd appreciate it.<br><b>THANKS IN ADVANCE</b>
19706,"hey guys so the highest GPA in my country is 4.00 and my GPA in the first year was less than 3.00 and have to repeat 2 classes, maybe that&#39;s because I have some organization &amp; event at that time. If u were me, what u should do in next semester? Focus on academic until ur GPA is more than 3,50 or still working on organization while study? Thankyou"
19707,"I just wanted to say that as a software developer, depending on what you’re making, the math and theory stuff you learn in a computer science course will actually be applied. Now you may not learn things like calculus or trigonometry which is the math you usually use in a program but still. A little math can help.<br><br>I had a teacher in high school who said programming is less about typing on a keyboard and more about knowing how to think, and how to problem solve. So yeah my point essentially is that theory is more important because it can be applied to any language. Even a software development degree wouldn’t have always been about coding. They’d have the business side of things too, they would have theory. So I don’t think you not expecting this was a problem since there’s really no other alternative. Sure maybe a software development degree would be more of specifically what you wanted but not really"
19708,Trust funds must be nice.
19709,"Two good things in this video:<br>The content,<br>And destination ( Morocco ) 😌"
19710,Number 1 thing i wish i knew before : Networking with people
19711,"Im thinking anout studyint informatic engineering, which is basically CS, and im really scared bc i like it but i think i like it i think im just too young yet to decide and universities in argentina are really different too and idk what to do bc if i dont do informatic engineering wtf do i do? Jsjsjja i just wanna be 6 y.o. again"
19712,1 to 2 hours a day of classes. Where tf are you going to school?
19713,"Our professors were only trained on how to teach us to pass exams, something you can&#39;t apply to the real world"
19714,man having adhd as a compsci major ain&#39;t fun
19715,"I feel you, cause I&#39;m the same too and I&#39;m trying not to procrastinate more , tq for some good talk"
19716,WELCOME TO MOROCCO BTW 🇲🇦
19717,Your regrets are same like mine as Computer Science student
19718,"I am gonna be honest, the video makes it seem like a big deal when it really isnt. As long as you actually like to program, you will be finding yourself doing it after college regardless. As long as you don&#39;t simply do what the exercises ask you to and play around with the concepts a bit, you&#39;ll be just fine.<br><br>Granted I live in a different country and that I am not CS but a SE,  from what I can see from friends in both areas:<br> CS is way more detailed, but all of that detail is useless unless you want to be maximazing you code efficiency, which is irrelevant for the most part. <br>SE is more broad, programming is not the focus but rather something you naturally learn in order to do the rest. It actually teaches you how to build platforms rather than scripts.<br><br>Either way, I am obviously biased, but both are valid options, as long as  you actually like it. <br><br>Regardless of your choice, try to go for a course that has a big practical component, as theory won&#39;t be of much help in the re world"
19719,I thought it was gonna be how you regret doing computer science and got spooked cause I want to do computer science (hopefully)
19720,At first i thought  it was jesus in the profile smh.
19721,I really needed it
19722,"I’m going to end up dead of I continue at this bullshit school, I hate CS &amp; I wish I could afford to drop or change majors without my parents disowning me. I don’t want to spend my life typing away at a computer"
19723,There&#39;s a hole in your t-shirt!
19724,im doin it for the money ngl
19725,"Yes, people need to understand that Computer Science ≠ Software Engineering. That&#39;d be like saying a marketing major and a graphic design major are the same."
19726,What boring stalling video i am halfway through and only 1 reason and 3 minutes of sellout not to mention intentionally slow talking
19727,that is exactly what happened to me
19728,true though😅😅
19729,This year is my first year college and i really forget about this and now i learned it in a hardway literally
19730,Lol same 😅
19731,Me: watching this in my senior year of highschool<br><br>Also me: Probably will forget this in college and learn the hard way.
19732,"Yeah, I think the contrast and saturation are too high"
19733,Is it just me or is the sharpness of this video too high like the lines and shadows look nasty
19734,&quot;..1-2 hours of classes a day and 7-8 hours of HW at home&quot;  what!   professors were the &quot;Eternal&quot; guys???
19735,@forrestknight can you suggest a method or a platform to apply for internships and explore opportunities
19736,i can&#39;t subscribe your channel why?
19737,I regret life
19738,wow i feel inspired
19739,Thumbnail me Justin Bieber bhosdika😂😂😂🤣🤣
19740,What regrets do you have?
19741,I am first year computer science student and I already have many regrets... Thanks for the advice 😭😭😭
19742,THOUGHT HE LOOKS LIKE JUSTIN BIEBER IN THE THUMBNAIL 🤪
19743,@S I N how did it go
19744,Some advice on Computer Engineering.. I&#39;m a freshman this year ...
19745,you learn to code in computer engineering?
19746,"As far as internships go, I got all of mine by attending career fairs at my University (UF). Major companies attend these events to scout new grads and interns....all you have to do a prep a resume &amp; elevator pitch and come in a suit! :) Do well enough in the pitch to a recruiter, and they&#39;ll give you an interview."
19747,I don&#39;t remember when I saw this video but I took the internship advice to heart and I&#39;m starting my first internship today and I&#39;m really excited about it ❤️
19748,"I totally agree on internships! I am a graduating senior in Computer Engineering, and I have done 4 internships. Internships really showed me what working was really like, and helped me find where I want to work. Despite being in the depressed COVID economy, I already have a job offer lined up for when I graduate in December!"
19749,Im interested in pursuing a software engineering career. Where do i start? I just started learning c++
19750,So university is basically a mexican highschool mid-quarantine?
19751,You look like JESUS
19752,Wait wait wait wait wait ... !!!!! 1-2 hr class a day .... Ur from alien planet or what... We have college from 9-5 = 8hrs + 2hr travel = 10hr total . And no self study lol
19753,"In Spain during the high school we spend like 6 hours a day in clases and we have a lot of homework to do at home, and in the University / College we spend about 7 hours a day, homework and studying a lot, that take us the whole day, all weeks..."
19754,For some stupid ass reason my degree includes physics 3 and this class is eatting all my time.
19755,"Office hours saved my life in college! Not even for the programming classes, but the math classes! Great vid"
19756,"Doing internships was really good for me too. Another tip I would add is, if you want to get a coding job, sign up as early as possible to websites such as leetcode or codewars, an try to get good at solving their problems."
19757,"Well.. it&#39;s 7-8 hours of college a day, for 5 days a week here in India. So, meh?"
19758,"I completed my masters in CS and last October I started my internship in iOS development, So I had to learn objective C I always loved C and CPP more then Java or Python but objective C is totally different and I feel like I don&#39;t know anything I have to start learning programming all over again.<br>Work and college life is totally different."

19761,Why why why?<br><br>Up...
19762,You look like if jesus had a child
19763,@Why must you disagree?? so why is BitSkulker surprised that my dude said: Morocco in Africa
19764,CJ UMEZ North America is continent bruh where did USA come from
19765,Africa is a continent tho. USA is a country
19766,&quot;Morocco... in Africa&quot; XD It&#39;s like saying &quot;the US... in North America&quot;
19767,Procrastinating on CS work while watching this video.
19768,"As a first year, I have to say that this video sure helps a lot in finding the best approach to tackle uni. Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll stop procrastinating but at least the rest helps lol"
19769,i want to work as an intern learn new things but i am from a country where there is not much iternship offering orgaizations SO is there a platform where i can learn coding and stuff related to CS JOBS also i can work<br><br>PLZ REPLY TO THIS
19770,Looking at the thumbnail I was sure he was going to give some Christopher McCandless advices.

19773,what are your thoughts in (BSIS) Information systems??
19774,i dunno man I have 40+ hours of college classes every week . So idk about the 2-8 ratio
19775,"What a pointless video, my man if you really want to learn code and programming you don&#39;t need to go to a college and waste 4 years you would&#39;ve become a master programmer and developer."
19776,Alright! Alright!! Alright!!!
19777,I&#39;m a business analyst right now. But also teaching myself web development. I was thinking of getting a job as a web developer. But I&#39;m not sure about it! Since the salary range for the both of jobs is also the same. &gt;_&lt;
19778,I waited until a 6:00pm to write an 8 page research paper that was due at 11:59pm. I bullshit my way to an A. I procrastinate because I bullshit well.

19787,"magnums_ferrari yes I agree but companies supporting legacy systems will never let go of it. Example, different projects of Lockheed and L3Harris that I’ve been on are still using it. A lot of the younger generations are pushing to transfer, but depending on release schedules of the project it’s a bit too late to transfer over."
19788,One regret of mine is not getting into real world application utilities early in College. For example GitHub or SVN(Getting Phased out but still good).<br><br>PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW IMPORTANT VERSIONING SYSTEMS ARE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY.
19789,Anyone told you that you look like Sawyer from Lost?
19790,So true......
19791,My favorite part was the bit about english being a fickle mistress. Nice video!
19792,That sponser was shameless ahaha. I don’t believe for one second that coincidentally the company that sponsors you just miraculously happened to be the same one that helped you through the course. Nothing wrong with taking sponsors you deserve to be paid for your content but that is just deceptive
19793,Lmao im still gonna major in it
19794,I have regret for CGPA. Cause I entered and saw they were asking 3rd year student  above 8/10 CGPA for internship. Mine was 6.73
19795,Why is his voice so clear he must go for voice actor
19796,"I agree with many of the points you went over in this video. I am currently a Comp Sci student in my junior year at UNF and so far I do like it, but it’s much more math than I expected."
19797,Sasta Shroud I feel as if women won’t get the same treatment when getting jobs in computer engineering or in general tbh
19798,only regret i have as a computer science student  is always surrounded by boys and no girls
19799,Now nobody&#39;s traveling
19800,My friend that did comp sci and is a software engineer said it was an easy degree and that calc 3 was the highest math he took and that it was easier than calc 2..  which I find hard to believe because I got through calc 2 without too much trouble for business school. This was a really good and true video that college is what you make out of it and if you try and work at it good things will come.
19801,College is more teaching you how to learn for the rest of your life not giving you a silver spoon.
19802,"They can’t teach you in college the way they do in high school in part because there isn’t enough time. Take calculus I. In High School you get five hours per week for nine months to learn the information, in college you get three hours per week for four months to learn that same information. If every college math class went at the high school rate then degrees would take 2-3x longer to get. Learning how to teach yourself is a benefit of the degree process, especially in tech where you’ll have to be learning constantly or else risk being obsolete within a few years. Obviously it’s not for everyone. If you only want to code, go to a coding boot camp (or teach yourself through internet resources) and don’t waste your time or money on college."
19803,"The whole college not like high school bugs me, I feel I understood my math completely from the high school teaching style. <br>They don&#39;t break it down, they skip (had my physics teacher go from some trig review straight into variables without explanation of what he was writing on the board) they leave you to struggle<br><br>High school would put something on the board, explain what it meant, went into detail how to solve it and show how you could solve different problems. It gave me a complete understanding of the subject, and its how I can breathe algebra 2 in my sleep. <br><br>The college having you figure it out is rather why would you pay for a teacher at that point if you&#39;re an autodidact on a time limit? If they&#39;re basically going to leave you to yourself might as well do it on your own with no $20k price."
19804,"I work in I.T already with no degree. I want to further my education to become network engineer or system admin. It&#39;s hard finding a college because most of the classes required for computer science degree require focus on programming, app development, etc. Which have nothing to do with what I want to do... Here goes to more college searching."
19805,check your mirror
19806,Why is my douchebag meter going off the scale within 5 seconds hmmm
19807,3 days left to my first computer science undergraduate class :)
19808,Can someone tell me please what are the office hours? :) I&#39;ve never heard of this term until now
19809,"Lol, I&#39;m taking Computer science HL starting next week and I&#39;m starting to doubt whether it&#39;d be good for a newbie like me. Any tips?"
19810,"I have a small project down in my pocket but other than that, I just have my courses I’m taking. Do most students get their internships because of the various projects they’ve done or because of their grade transcripts, how? Or is it somewhat lucky? Seems like whenever I try going to the job fair, I’m just punching A brick wall and can’t get one."
19811,"Your suggestion on using office hours, I also wish I would have done that more. Maybe not due to me not being able to get a topic but, to expand my understanding past that point. It&#39;s so important that&#39;s so very true!"
19812,Im a about to start freshman year and want to study cs. I&#39;ve got into coding in elementary and loved it every since. I learned about cs in middle school and im currently studying and learning what cs is. So far i love it and hope i can get a degree
19813,"Tell me if u see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=4m28s"">4:28</a>"

19815,Holy smake its justin bieber
19816,So you just regret being a lousy student. This is not specific to computer science
19817,Was useful! I am doing my computer science engineering rn! I ll keep these in mind.
19818,Dont forget to code
19819,What your HW in highschool was of 1-2 hours???  What country are you from? <br>My teachers give me a shit tone of HW it takes my and my classmates 2-3 hours or 5 hours sometimes
19820,thank you for this trying to figure out if this is what i want to do going into it with not much knowledge
19821,you mean luggages?
19822,May programmers cover them up with thick glasses -:)

19825,You mean bugs?
19826,You can tell he&#39;s in cs by the 3 sets of bags under his eyes
19827,Professors or tutors but I couldn&#39;t agree more.
19828,"Your mistake was going to a university instead of a junior college.  If you  went to a  junior college, then you would have known what everything was before making it your major.  Junior college is where you get all your gen eds out of the way.  For me, I took absolutely no gen  eds at a university, and therefore my GPA started as a completely blank slate at a university. And don&#39;t just go to the closest junior college to your house, check out the neighboring 1 or 2 counties to see what those junior colleges are like."
19829,also me <b>laughs in omani</b>
19830,*You pay alot of money to get to college*.  <br><br>Me : <b>laughs in saudi where we don&#39;t pay for college AND get 266 US dollars per month</b>
19831,"That is a huge change in industry medical labor to tech?, why nursing in the first place if you want a job related to computers? You need to think this through about what you really want. Or other degrees related to computers <br><br>FYI most comp sci requires pre-cal 1, pre-cal 2, cal 1 and cal 2."
19832,Nursing major rn and thinking of changing to CS major since i like something that is related to computers but math is my weakness :(
19833,2 separate
19834,"I just stumbled across this due to search history algorithms and the fact that I just went BACK to school for CS, so i&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading on what I kind of want to &quot;focus&quot; on. Some serious advice here, for anyone who bothers to read the comments, get an entry IT certification (or study) like CompTIA A+. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how college skims over important aspects of how computers store, process, and exchange data. This won&#39;t only give you a leg up in classes, but it&#39;s also a litmos test for whether you will actually enjoy the field."
19835,are there any nicknames for a guy named forrest?
19836,"I regret not watching this one year earlier.<br>I am a second year IT student,I am treating college like high school, I don&#39;t work on home projects and I am procrastinating a lot, I study for tests the night before the test or on the bus while going to college, I study for exams one to two days before it, I do homeworks at the last hour.<br>I am ready for internships but I don&#39;t think I can find a relevant one here"
19837,This fool looks like freaking Justin biber on puberty pills 🤣🤣🤣
19838,Semhle.
19839,actually gave me a bit more motivation for my classes
19840,Can relate.
19841,What degree should I pursue if I wanna learn how to code and build software
19842,BINOD
19843,I start my freshman year of college as a comp sci student in a few weeks. Thanks YouTube
19844,So when u went home u went home.very interesting🤔
19845,How much is the pay
19846,Well if your motivation for studying CS was how your classmates looked then thats pretty dumb
19847,Wow if my fellow male comp sci classmates looked like this I would NEVER skip class phew.
19848,welcome in Morocco Bro Hhh❤

If I go back to school I&#39;ll probably go for systems engineering rather than CS.<br><br>The well-rounded student thing is a line of bullshit that every university feeds you. They don&#39;t prepare you for the real world. They don&#39;t prepare you for dealing with stupid clients and avoiding scope creep.

What&#39;s more is that I&#39;m being paid to learn versus paying to learn something in the academic world.<br><br>Maybe their are some better universities that teach the things I&#39;ve mentioned.

19854,welcome to morroco homie
19855,As a computer science student I can relate
19856,"Hey ForrestKnight, I would agree about most of the things you had talked up until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=7m48s"">7:48</a> - Imagine - free collage, lots of peers, and that&#39;s about that... then comes hard thought math and physics, like really wanting you to drop-off (free remember?), teachers openly talking politics, exams consisting of incomprehensible questions which require lots of writing stuff down with pen &amp; paper with no accessible tables of common conversions, equations, and stuff; paper? I come with an early-term homework completely solved in a computer program (C# that was the part of the 1st-semester curriculum) which was denied because the solution should be on paper with &quot;physics &amp; math&quot;. Calculating the processor job on the whiteboard - base10/base2 conversion and adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing what was required to be even considered present at the end-term exam (publicly at the whiteboard) (btw beside that, my favorite class)... If you read this, come to Poland and teach them how to teach calculus with no-stress factor, please... And I failed mostly because I suck at math, I did the study, and did dying part of studying even trying to learn from English language resources which were more understandable for me, it&#39;s just it didn&#39;t click 😇"

19878,Me: a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Major in Computer Science Student<br><br>Also me: Why ever i choose this course?
19879,I’d rather self teach myself how to code then do some freelance work
19880,Sad
19881,I feel pressure on what course to choose and I’m in Scotland where University or college is completely free so I can’t imagine the pressure for Americans where they have to pay so much for their course so it really has to count😬
19882,Welcome bro to Morocco
19883,How&#39;s it going for your boyfriend?
19884,i clicked on this because my boyfriend is going into computer science and i wanted to be prepared to support him if anything but i didn’t expect to get college advice for myself lol
19885,Bruh I&#39;m here  cuz I picked computer science for GCSE so thank you for making the vid
19886,What you said about computer science applies to me and it&#39;s really disappointed me
19887,what a coincidence watching this from Morocco : )
19888,@K no its not ofc
19889,Was IT a waste of money?
19890,My regret is not thinking about what I wanted to do before I enrolled my self to College with a degree in IT
19891,"I thought this was Jesus! I was again, deceived."
19892,He looks like a character from watchdogs
19893,I wasted time changing my major to Computer Science. Then one day in was sitting in Physics class thinking &quot; wtf does 3 dimensional projectile motion have to do with computers&quot;. Dropped out and signed up for a computer tech trade school.
19894,right now im applying to IT collages and I&#39;m sterssing up i won&#39;t get into anything so im manifesting it and trying to get my dream life
19895,"Lol wow you wouldn’t have survived in my uni, oxford and cambridge professors scared my classmates to death. We started with 62 students, after 3 weeks it went down to 21 as everyone moved to Biology because our course was ‘wayy too hard’. Then 6 months later there were only 8 of us 😂 I graduated happily but it was extremely difficult honestly. I’m so glad I stuck with it and worked my arse off. We learned Python, R and SQL for the informatics field which became my dissertation and what I really love to integrate biology, chemistry, physics, statistics and programming/computer science together. But I guess not everybody likes Biochemistry 🤷‍♂️"
19896,What is ODU?
19897,My regrets: that I have to write a dissertation
19898,None of what you said applies to Indian Colleges except IITs 😓which I didn&#39;t get into
19899,College 1-2 hrs a day ? 😶 we have 6 hours of college and every minute of it is awful
19900,"While I&#39;m not a cs major and I&#39;m a Cybersecurity major, most of these are very similar regrets. Only things I&#39;d say are I wish I started really getting into Linux before college. Pretty much everything except memory dumps because I don&#39;t enjoy digital forensics work. Doing things like setting up ELK and Splunk or at least knowing what they are in hs would have been really nice. Also getting into the Linux command line more would have been really nice since all I use windows for in class is for addc, DNS, and DHCP with the occasional dfs server setup. That&#39;s about it (my major is computer network and cybersecurity so yes. We do every from basic help desk stuff all the way to soc and even a little bit of xss and some other stuff. Ngl it&#39;s a lot of fun)"
19901,"Start @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a>"
19902,"Anyone considering a CS degree should first take 1 online course on coursera and then 1 course a community college in programming. Don&#39;t even stress about learning algorithms/linear algebra just yet. Do those 2 things, then code something for &#39;fun&#39; in C++, Python, or R, and then ask yourself: &quot;money aside, is this something I can actively do for 30-35hrs/week for 5-10+ years in a career.&quot;  <br><br>I enjoyed programming, I enjoyed algorithms, but there&#39;s no way I can do that for a full time job for YEARS"
19903,"So if you procrastinate during high school and wing it, it doesn’t serve you well in college. Totally different ballgame. You’ll be surprised at how college teaches you the discipline of working hard."
19904,True. it’s a totally different ballgame.
19905,"Valuable advice. especially the difference between high school and college- I never realized this.  I was the best student in my school even without trying,  at the college, I struggled I could not understand what is happening."
19906,😂 welcome to Morocco
19907,I&#39;m so lazy bro in my comp sci classes
19908,Wow you’re really pretty.
19909,Thanks for mentioning internships. I’m early in my journey and that was really helpful!!
19910,After watching this video.. I feel a lot more confident than I was. Arigato sensi!!
19911,do computer engineering needs a  good mind in mathematics??
19912,"I regret doing it at all.  After the advent of smart phones, the rise of clouds and data collection, and the dumbing-down of UI design, I&#39;ve all but lost interest in computers.  Things are nowhere near as fun and exciting as they used to be because I just don&#39;t feel that the software industry actually SOLVES problems anymore.  Ethics is at an all-time low, and it&#39;s all about making money by any means necessary.  Game development is about the last truly interesting frontier, because it&#39;s more about art than &quot;problem solving&quot;.<br><br>Thankfully I&#39;m semi-retired, so I can still code strictly as a hobby. Doing it professionally was fun at first, but... now priorities are different."
19913,Any tips of what to keep in mind when shortlisting a college for the CS degree? especially if one would be a foreign student?
19914,"i was like you, thinking computer science is just doing coding. thank god i liked math cause if i was not, i have made a big mistake"
19915,So Walton Goggins is my fellow CS graduate
19916,you look like a justin bieber and james franco fusion
19917,"I wish Id gotten to this video earlier, Im a junior atm and it feels like it&#39;s all too late now"
19918,engineer jesus
19919,John B?
19920,What i regret thr most as a computer  science student in my 3rd semester is my decision of choosing computer science as my degree
19921,ikr
19922,Where&#39;s that angelist link? lol
19923,The only other undergrad degree that stands out to me is History....and I get told repeatedly that it&#39;s a useless degree unless you&#39;re going into Academia....which I get. <br><br>But I&#39;m absolutely fascinated with History and even write multi-page papers on Events and Figures just to have for myself (the latest one I wrote was about the ever-changing hierarchy regarding the Islamic State (ISIS) and it&#39;s &quot;conception&quot; up until they were rooted out of Syria - for the most part).
19924,"So if I&#39;m trash at math do I even remotely have a chance at a CS Degree? My Uncle is a Data Scientist and, along with making fat stacks of cash, his work seems <b>genuinely</b> interesting to me. <br><br>I asked how I could find a job like his and he said &quot;Just get a Bachelor&#39;s or Masters in Computer Science, interviews will come naturally&quot;....<br><br>Idk about that."
19925,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=9m40s"">9:40</a> wowww that was a shot lmaoo"
19926,Really helpful video thanks :)
19927,You&#39;re still a human. You deserve some time out.
19928,I am in dilemma.. Should I focus on school and quit my job or attain classes while I work from 9-5.. 😞
19929,Do you think someone can attain collage while they have a 9-5 job?
19930,Is working from home a normal thing for a computer science major?
19931,Thanks for the video. Very insightful. Enjoy Morocco! :)
19932,Great Advice!!
19933,I&#39;m a college student this year yet I didn&#39;t enroll yet for college because I just receive my certification candidacy  and also I hate math I sucked fuck.. and I&#39;m thinking about Computer science and IT although I sucked at math.. <br>Help me with what will I chose .
19934,"i like the way you teach, i think it would be easy to understand for us ,the learners, if you posted videos on upgrading different programming language skills specially python."
19935,Should I major in CS if I want to make an AI learn how to flirt?
19936,"@Pedro Haha, I mean they are very different, I&#39;d say physics is hard when it comes to understanding theory. For the practical part I&#39;d say computer science because it takes creativity, troubleshooting and time. But, really when it comes to any career there is no easy one, but physicists do think they are the smartest haha"
19937,"My sister is a physics engineering student in USP(Brazil), and I’m studying Statistics which involve a lot of programming, she thinks that her course is the hardest and that I have it easy LOL 😂"
19938,"Literally I just got my master at computer science, all of this is still true, I am a physics engineer so my college experience was different. This computer science thing is so time consuming!! I think having some friends that are good students is also a great idea to give you some help when you burn out!! Nice vid"
19939,10hrs college and 5hrs homework 😅
19940,he&#39;s hot
19941,ODU? You live in VA very nice
19942,Procastination should be done but in a good way
19943,"Other than a laptop, what do I need for a CS degree?"
19944,im from morocco
19945,1-2 hour class and 6-7 hour homework? What in the world???
19946,Get this man an acting career in OuterBanks
19947,What a good fucking camera
19948,My biggest regret is to select the field of Computer Science
19949,This guy will make me cry because he is telling all my pain as a Software engineering student 😭
19950,If Matthew McConaughey was not an actor
19951,If Matthew McConaughey was not an actor
19952,you know wht you are talking about
19953,Is this video sponsored or is it not?
19954,I was definitely planning to pick up an internship during breaks or something if you haven’t answered this my question is what computer should I get to do all these projects on I’m trying to get the hang of everything for next year to get a head start (plus I been in the military for 5 years I’m rusty at everything that isn’t military rn)😬
19955,This video helped so much thank you! I&#39;m in grade 10 and trying to figure out if I really wanna do Comp sci but this gave me a lot of insight.
19956,Changed my life... Wow
19957,@Erick Siavichay how much money you get payed? is it alot?
19958,"You only need to worry if you know not having to be at a designated time and place for lectures is what keeps you doing school. If your the kind of person who pushes off lectures videos because, eh I can watch em anytime, your gonna have a hard time."
19959,@Erick Siavichay yep Im doing it here in Australia. Its basically the same doing it online as it is on campus. Its just a bit less social :/
19960,How is it soo far bro.
19961,"@LioH &quot;people are very helpful online&quot;<br><br><b>asks question on stackoverflow</b><br><br><b>gets downvoted 4 times</b><br><b>gets corrected for spelling mistakes, which weren&#39;t even spelling mistakes</b><br>*recieves a ban for answering other questions *"
19962,"Im taking CS, and it scares me especially with this pandemic since I&#39;ll be attending an online classs."
19963,What were your grades through out college? We’re you an outstanding 4.0 student or a pretty average 3.0 student?
19964,I don’t even have lectures in my class right now. Just a textbook and a list of assignment and when to submit them online &gt;.&lt;
19965,Y&#39;all pay how much to go to class for 1 to 2 hours in the US? And then do everything yourself at home? Next joke please
19966,Juice Honestly? Dont depend on your professors to explain it 😂😂😂😂😂 You would better off listening to lectures online . Because most professors complicate the concept and you&#39;ll never understand it but other than that it&#39;s a very interesting field 😂😂😂 Its hard but worth it
19967,how is it? i’m thinking of entering the field 😭
19968,Incoming CS Student in 20 days xD
19969,My man how did you apply for these internship. where did you find places to do internship at. I am clueless
19970,He looks like Jesus.
19971,I&#39;m in college now and your tips is soooooo good and relatable. It&#39;s definitely something I should do from now on :D thank you for the good video!
19972,There is nothing wrong with having a bit of &quot;recreational footage&quot; in front or at the end of your videos.
19973,i&#39;m from Morocco <br>we actually spend about 8 hours a day in class
19974,What is Bioinformatics?
19975,"I’m currently doing a bioinf degree. Bioinformatics is a lot of working on lots of genome data. It’s more like data science as you process huge genome data files and then analyze them so wet lab people make the right decisions. In your degree, you will have comp sci courses, bio and chem courses, stats courses, and courses where you learn bioinformatics software tools etc. honestly it’s an interesting and high paying degree from what I can see and I don’t even see myself necessarily doing a bioinformatics career, but many of the skills you learn look transferable to other bioengineering jobs etc"
19976,"i want to take bioinformatics and i need to focus on biology , computer science and maths udfiweu i wonder if im making the right choice"
19977,start a second channel man. You seem like a charismatic dude and I&#39;d watch the shit out of you and your dog
19978,Dude you look like an model
19979,Man my university sucks.
19980,"How did you find high school internships. I&#39;ve been trying to find them but I can&#39;t. The ones I do know about are junior/senior locked, but you said you had some out of sophomore year so I was just wondering how you got them?"
19981,"studying computer science is not studying programming. if you love programming already, you should just work."
19982,Where&#39;s the AngelList link? :&lt;
19983,Is it just me or does he give me some Matthew McConaughey vibe ?
19984,keep the channel bro
19985,Thanks. This helped me feel better.

And if they are any help, their offices are jam-packed."
19989,this video was the first video i’ve seen of yours and your introduction was way too long and I disliked the video cause you just kept talking about things that were irrelevant to sole purpose of it. stop wasting everyone’s time.
19990,I can relate to the High school part.<br>U got a new sub bro.<br>I love ur channel
19991,I&#39;m reverse procrastinating. <br>I&#39;m doing my work as fast as I can in the beginning and enjoying my life watching suffering friend trying to finish their deadline. Muahahaha.
19992,"And after completing 12th with computer science , what course I should do to become a data scientist ,,, is their any particular course or wht .. Plse I need your response"
19993,We had very differing internship experiences lol. All the ones I had were heavily coding based. Maybe it depends on the area you&#39;re in?
19994,"If anyone is trying to find a programming job in uni, highly recommend asking teachers if they have research projects to work on"
19995,is this jesus?

20006,I&#39;m unsure of where to even start learning though I&#39;ve heard of coding boot camp but have seen mixed opinions about it
20007,"Devin Clay, just keep practicing it and you will eventually learn. I have 8 years of Java experience. My first two years were the hardest, and the next six years were the easiest."
20008,My issue is I have no experience in the field just fascination and after doing research and starting classes I know this is something I was to chase down and learn so I&#39;m not sure how to write software or code even
20009,"Devin Clay, work on open source projects online, write your own software, etc. use this to demonstrate to your employer. By “job experience,” they mean experience actually contributing to projects or writing programs."

20017,You didn&#39;t study computer science until you&#39;ve studied it correspondence
20018,One thing you will regret is not saying happy. So always stays happy.🙂🙃

20039,What you’re describing is exactly what I’m going through right now as a CS student
20040,Love y’all stay safe ❤️❤️❤️
20041,after watching a lot of these videos it makes me wonder why we even pay for school. a lot of people have said that most of the time in a CS major they are given the bare bone basics and the rest they have to learn for themselfs. so why the fuck do you have to pay thousands of dollars every year to get told &quot;hey heres the bare minimum go google this entire language and figure it out for yourself &quot;

20052,Has anyone told you you look just like McConaughey in True Detective?
20053,It’d be great if my professors could speak English properly... even after they’ve lived in an American suburbia for 10 years

20055,"I re-entered university to pursue a Master&#39;s degree in computer science this month after I was unable to find a job with my bachelor&#39;s in applied mathematics (go figure, maths is hard as fuck AND at the same time you&#39;re also entirely worthless on the job market).<br>Feels like I&#39;m digging my own grave deeper and deeper each waking minute. Real hard to keep from becoming suicidal again at this current stage ín my life."
20056,"Yeah, university is different. Content isn&#39;t harder, but tests are harder for no reason. Community college you would be taught the stuff on exams, uni is... ehhhhh... kind of?"
20057,"Ha, in High School I had a lot of HW and didn&#39;t need to study much and college is no different. To be fair, I am at a community college in the 2nd year. Maybe it will be different at my state college."

20062,I’m procrastinating my AP computer science work while watching this video
20063,It&#39;s the schools job to mislead and guide you. A Young mind is easy to deceive. It&#39;s not your fault for not knowing that a cs degree isn&#39;t the same as a degree in web development. That&#39;s how the schools making money by preying off our ignorance.
20064,Me rn
20065,I regretted  being a full time student while being chronically depressed.  I didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me and I stressed myself out most of the time during university.  I was not mentally prepared for the workload I needed to do.  And I was too clouded to realize I didn&#39;t need to take on the load I was while trying to figure out why my mind and thoughts were what they were.

By doing some extra work and refining it, you can learn more and employers may notice it in the future. Follow what else this video says and make sure your grades are up to get a good program in college"

20081,I wish i was in america. University there costs more it&#39;s way easier than in europe. <br>Here in Europe you have to stay 6-8 hours in college and you have to study at home for 6-8 hours too.

20083,Hi l&#39;m from &quot; morroco from africa &quot;
20084,"I have an AAS in Electronics Technology, sort of the same thing as Computer Science. Had to only get assembly language along with the compiler and you have to under stand every chip and component on the board, when it doesn&#39;t work you have to figure out is it the board or the code."
20085,"My advice as a freshman, is to go to office hours and do your homework there. The TA’s will literally help you and possibly give you answers to the code :)"
20086,Nice videos
20087,Too much verbiage. Wasted my two minutes.
20088,remember when you had 50K you growing up in the community
20089,awesome ideas and experience explanations <br>thanks for them
20090,@KuroZavi me too omg no computer science degree for me ig
20091,your homeless bruh damn now im scared
20092,Bruh I should’ve watched this before going homeless bc of how I treated the exact same story. Changed my outlook man thank you.
20093,I regret <br><br>Nothing
20094,@Texsic Thank you very much.
20095,"Man I&#39;m in  high school and I wanna do programming I don&#39;t even have my own computer but at school we do  computer basics like access,excel,HTML, and word. So do I need to  have my own computer to be a computer program or should I wait until collage . cause my parents can&#39;t afford it advice man"
20096,office hours lol
20097,I&#39;m scared
20098,Stop the bullshit
20099,I want to see this list in 5 years. 😆
20100,"Thanks Mr Knight, I appreciated the insight."
20101,"@Zephire 262 Okay, thanks, and sorry for talking a lot but last question: Do you have any suggestions for easy AP Courses to take or some of the harder ones not to take?"
20102,"@Yotam Jotham I mean if you think they would be of value to you and if you&#39;ll be getting credit I say go for it. But also it is a lot of work. Think abt how much work you get with your two AP courses then double that. That&#39;s how it&#39;ll feel taking four, and even more with five. If you feel up to the challenge and wanna get that credit I say go for it! Otherwise, there rly is no point to all the stress, you&#39;d be better off and happier with a lighter schedule haha"
20103,"@Zephire 262 Of course I would get college credit with them, and I am already in 2 AP Courses, but considering I will pass all my AP exams, Is it a bad idea considering that my credits might not count for college simply because of relevance? What I&#39;m saying is do I need all my APs to fall under a certain category to matter, like maybe if I do random ones will that be pointless."
20104,"@Yotam Jotham Mm, that&#39;s honestly kinda tough to say lol. I did end up getting quite a bit of college credit from it, and so now even tho I am only in my second term of college as a first year technically in terms of my credit standing I am a sophomore. In that sense, it was worth it. However, if you are not getting college credit for it, then honestly I&#39;d only take one or two, maybe three tops. More than that is just too much stress for no college credit in my opinion."
20105,"@Zephire 262 would you say it was worth it though, like how many did you take? I plan on taking 4-5 during my junior and senior years"
20106,"&quot;In college you go for 1-2 hours of classes a day and 7-8 hours of HW at home.&quot;<br>huhh!<br>Not in India bruh, Not in India"

20108,Didn’t kno Justin Bieber is CS
20109,Hey great video would be very happy if you were to response to this comment so what advice would you give a high school leaver looking forward to studying computer science
20110,"Thanks for the video man, this is very helpful warning for me to prepare college in the future!"
20111,That is not CS internship work. That is IT
20112,Why are you even ever going to your professor? Going to a class itself is pretty much useless(except to attend quizzes). Go spend your time with the TA!  Your TA is your Alpha and Omega
20113,This is so true! I&#39;ve had to figure our EVERYTHING on my own! Why do they even have &quot;professors&quot; or &quot;instructors&quot;? They just read powerpoint slides and were completely useless.
20114,I love the office aspect part... so sad in my countrry you never meet the professors in their office till you get your PhD
20115,college is a scam.  but sometimes we have to go with it with at least this generation as the older generation still hold onto this scam.
20116,new channel sir
20117,Felt that too
20118,i have computer science ebooks available
20119,Every path leads to StackOverflow 🤣
20120,I liked your comment just so it becomes 100 from 99😂
20121,It hit home for me too. Alas at time I do not even find the solution to my problems of the internet!!
20122,When he said googling things every other minute I felt that
20123,My main fear as a first year of Computer Science is not being good enough at the languages we’re being taught to work in industry. Am I just worrying unnecessarily or is this a valid fear and is there a solution?
20124,You remind me of Sawyer from lost
20125,You make a new channel
20126,Where was your first internship at?
20127,"The funny part here in Greece (technical University) , we have like 6 + hour lessons a day at University and 6 hour Homework/studying at home 😂"
20128,"I&#39;ve had the same experience with some of my CS profs. The problem (at least where I live) is that they force professors to teach. A lot of professors are in it for the research, and don&#39;t care about teaching. So you end up with a lot of teachers who don&#39;t actually want to do the teaching, but they&#39;re forced into it. I think the UK has a system where you can either go into research or teaching, which sounds better than forcing people to teach if they don&#39;t want to."
20129,"computer science instructors know nothing (not all though but the ones taught me), they want you to solve everything by yourself and you gain nothing from them, they just put too many assignments and they don&#39;t actually read it, when you try to ask them to figure something out, they simply say &quot;google it&quot; and this is hard for new people, I remember the first semester was really hard for me, a lot of work, assignments, bad environment, no help at all, but at the end, I really love my major, thank god!!"
20130,"Thank you very much for your time, to make us feel like we are not alone 🙌🏽 computer science is the future right now"
20131,You are a good man. Thank you.
20132,My brother want to know which is better computer science or computer information system who can help me
20133,What type of camera/lens do you use?
20134,"I would also add getting head starts on concepts, especially in your junior year! Getting a good head start on what you&#39;ll be doing for your senior capstone project is incredibly useful. Also, learn how to write genuinely good user stories. That will truly save your life."
20135,advice

20148,Cut it out  bruh
20149,@B&#39; Mk  same for me could you tell me what happened with u
20150,"I understand how you feel. It’s hard and it’s not going to get easier until you graduate and then working too is hard. Life is hard. But! There’s a silver lining. When you feel overwhelmed, take a breather. DO NOT STRESS ABOUT it. I literally do other things to relax like go for a walk, play some music, get that much needed nap, drink your favorite drink. Just take a break so you don’t burn out. Take your mind off your school work or topics. Watch a movie that will make you forget. Then come back to the task at hand with a better and clearer mind. Just think about it, today it’s not done. Tomorrow is another day another chance to work on it so try working on it the next day or so. Until you finish. Good luck and may you succeed in everything you set your eyes on!!!! Go get it tiger"
20151,@Sakovska im in the same position as u ! how do things go for u now?
20152,How do you feel now?
20153,"I&#39;m an incoming freshman and really like to take Computer Science, my knowledge in it isn&#39;t really broad. Obviously I get a lot of negative comments around me like most people say it&#39;s really hard. I&#39;m not actually good in math, but I really want that course. I&#39;m half discouraged and half motivated, but I guess really have to apply much effort into that course"
20154,this helped me so much as a cs student. im currently in my 2nd year and is quite discouraged because its too overwhelming. i need goals and motivations and i needed to know if there were people who felt as i do atm
20155,I procrastinate quite a lot as well but I’m a senior in highschool
20156,i have to say it was a good video i am also looking at taking  computer science and have learned alot from this video
20157,Omg I graduated ODU too!!!!
20158,"lol, I live in Norfolk, flipped out when I heard he went to ODU   go monarchs!!!"

20163,"It was in my Algorithms and Data structures class that I realized there was probably no other major for me. Regardless of if my grades weren&#39;t doing so hot, I found a way to get pulled in by the subject and solving problems. I&#39;d likely be bored out of my mind doing anything else."
20164,"Don&#39;t go to college for software. Teach yourself and save the money. No one even requires degrees anymore. If you want to do some school, do a bootcamp (bootcamps are NOT all-encompassing. You need to supplement with your own coding)."

20180,Can you share some of the internships you took part in so we can also look into them?
20181,Everyone talks about how high school should teach us how to do our taxes or other &quot;practical&quot; stuff but really if college just taught us good time management and the ability to problem solve then we&#39;d be set. We could even use those skills to finally figure out how our taxes work.

20190,I am starting my final semester in CS next week and I had one tech support job in web development for 2 years and no internships. Should I be worried about that? I&#39;m trying to get a job now.
20191,"Well said. I plan to start showing this video to my students. The comments by some of your subscribers, like B Ndoye, are useful, too. Thanks for making this video."
20192,hey! i&#39;m 18 years old and want to find a job in tech. would you recommend me to do a software development apprenticeship (where i work and learn on the job) or do a computer science degree. since you&#39;re saying it&#39;s mainly theory.. i want to be done with school ASAP and want to start working and think an apprenticeship is amazing for me and more so reading the comments since a computer science degree is mainly theory and not much coding (which is why i want to get a cs degree).  &amp; is there anything more i need to know about a cs degree or working in tech in general . thank u if u respond!
20193,"So little actual coding... 2 semesters of Java, 1 semester of SQL, 1 semester of AngularJS, rest was theory and DBMS systems."
20194,I think a lot of people would need to know how it feels to be jobless and poor before going on to higher education.
20195,"keep that grind up, and more importantly mess around with coding outside of school for your free time. I didn&#39;t get into coding until Junior year and didn&#39;t really start coding on my own for fun until Senior year and honestly the more you get done in highschool the faster you get over the first couple walls and can start doing really fun stuff / cruise through the first few years of college"
20196,"I&#39;m a sophomore in high school but these types of videos still really do inspire me. Currently doing computer science principles as an elective, coding with Java next year, and cyber security senior year, and this definitely looks like the future I want and need. Especially if it&#39;s to do with computer hardware."
20197,Soooo
20198,Hi i am in Tashkent if you know i am studying in computer science and engineering in the first semester can you give advices related to this actually pros and cons
20199,they make bank too. it&#39;d be such a pain to get a phd in cs and the other work it takes but if u make it to a professor after a few years of figuring out how to teach the same 2-3 classes over and over its the life
20200,"Learn how you learn best. It might not be for everyone but if your teacher is terrible, you might be better off learning by yourself from a textbook. It works for me, never again am I wasting 2-4 hours a week in a classroom with a teacher that actually hinders my learning process. It&#39;s astounding how many bad teachers there are out there."
20201,Where did you graduate on your Computer Science degree?
20202,"I just switched my major from radiology to Computer Science, hopefully, your tips gonna help me in my upcoming semester."
20203,"online classes help, and kinda depends on your schedule. last semester I fr had 2-3 hr days of classes only M/W/F and no class T/TH (but worked).<br><br>this semester there is some breaks inbetween but im pretty much stuck going to class from like 11am-6pm almost everyday bc i have so many forced in person classes and all their recitations."
20204,You only had class for 1-2 hours per day?<br>fucking lucky...wtf
20205,"you&#39;re better off using free resources to learn programming basics then after that could try to just read textbooks for computer science related topics, and if that doesn&#39;t work then maybe pay for courses. But if you&#39;re interested in just learning programming for a hobby/potential job you can get pretty far without paying but it takes insane work and consistency if you&#39;re already working a real job and have that adult life"
20206,"I am going to start auditing computer science courses in order to learn computer programming not because I want a degree but because I want to learn this as a hobby and maybe a side gig. I love computers and software and think that I have something to offer the world through software and automated solutions. I think I am doing the right thing, but I am nervous."
20207,Uhmmmmmm maybe this won&#39;t work out in my country =))
20208,Why is this guy&#39;s thumbnail so fucking ugly... I vomit
20209,Yeah as a software engineering... duh... college is what you put into it. They give you a taste. The rest it research. No more spoon feeding.
20210,Nice video man. Good Job. Currently a IT student trying to get info  computer  science.
20211,relatable
20212,"there isn&#39;t really a way other then to keep practicing, trying, struggling. it would help a lot if you could find someone who is more experienced who can help/guide you.<br><br>I&#39;ve been at it for almost 5 years now and I still remember the first 6 months or so it would not click for me. I was easily a few months in my class and I was still asking people to spoonfeed me and tell me what a method was lol. It took so much time and effort and I can&#39;t exactly remember when it clicked, maybe it&#39;s just gradual over time.<br><br><br> I remember for me I started seeing patterns of the programs we had to make through sheer repetition, like I knew that most of the time when I made a for loop there was a good chance there was going to be an if statement inside, and then I would have to think is that something that makes sense for this specific problem and go from there. just a process in the end even if you catch a bad grade or two it will eventually work out if u keep at it."
20213,Tell me how it goes because I&#39;m thinking of majoring in Computer Science and I already know it won&#39;t be easy but I&#39;m willing to take the risk.
20214,"I&#39;m a first year data analytics student at my college, and I going into this semester i had no coding experience whatsoever. I am currently in a intro to java course, and it is more difficult than i thought. I understand all the syntax but the logic part isnt clicking for me yet. Is this normal? What can I do to improve? I make tiny improvements but nothing nearly big enough to which I can write my own programs. I want to be able to learn soon because I am taking a harder CSE class next semester and if im struggling now then I will be struggling even more next semester. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks."
20215,"Am an IT major,  and every internship i looked at the summer after freshman year had requirements of junior or senior.  That&#39;s because they want you to transition into FT. I ended up working parttime at a tech company,  and taking on opportunities for my resume like projects,  learn new languages,  get certs, etc. Now im going into junior year and have 2 internships lined up"
20216,What do you think of graduate degrees for cs students ? Have you gotten one?
20217,I REGRET GOING TO COLLEGE AND GETTING A CS DEGREE. BECAUSE THROUGH OUT THE DEGREE I WORKED A LOT...... I NEVER HAD ALL THE TIME TO STUDY LIKE OTHER STUDENTS WHERE MOM AND DAD PAID FOR EVERYTHING. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND LACK OF SLEEP. LACK OF FRIENDSHIPS and LACK OF BEING ABLE TO FULLY DEEP DIVE INTO AREA of PROGRAMMING.

20221,my thought before clicking on this video:<br>if i were to make a video with the same title it would go like this:<br>my regrets as a computer science student: 1.being a computer science student<br>the end...
20222,how did u apply for internships in college? like did u have a website that u applied on?
20223,Don’t know about what high schools people go to but the world load is a lot at mine. 3 to 4 hours of homework a day
20224,If Matthew McConaughey’s Mud was a software developer...
20225,So I wanted to get into machine learning for a while now. Turns out procrastinating for 3 months straight is not a productive strategy...
20226,I am a computer engineering student that grew up on the farm. I would love to see you integrate your fishing/outdoor stuff to this channel.
20227,You look homeless bruh
20228,"Well this might be a regret for me in the future but I hate the feeling of never knowing enough and never being able to do enough. I&#39;m simultaneously learning unity, android in kotlin, watching tutorials on some of my subjects in college, python with django and just life in general. But I&#39;m motivated. I&#39;m not burnt out yet... And hopefully I don&#39;t get burnt out cause I&#39;m having fun admist all the stress"
20229,"I love the logic behind the computers and technology overall but i hate math, im very bad at it, im now in my third year with everything passed and idk how to even do pre calculus......."
20230,"I find it funny when he says “when you have your class 1 to 2 hours a day”. I have 7 to 8 hours of class a day, I’m so exausted. And they expect me to work even more when I get home.<br><br>How about no XD"
20231,Bro do a second channel to get some money
20232,Adesso ho paura
20233,Italian unis be like: &quot;6-7 hours of classes and 5-6 hours of self-study&quot;
20234,is computer science a good course to take? what do u think?
20235,In your college classes were 1-2 hrs/day??<br>I had to go through 7.5 hrs/day of classes
20236,i also didnt know james franco had a computer science degree
20237,"@C. Grant thanks for the tip.  Im in my 30s and went back to school because ive become jaded with the sales world and pickedd computer science because i have the intellect for it and also i have always generally been good with computers , and my counselor chose intro to programming which seemed like it would go over core concepts first, but a combination of the book being very difficult for someone with no programming background(Ken Lamberts Python book), plus the fact that i had 4 other classes to keep up with and my programming teacher is very old school and even though our class is small he did not dedicate a reasonable amount of time (in my opinion, and in alot of others I&#39;ve ran this by&#39;s opinion, and I made sure they werent just telling me what i wanted to hear) to explainining specifics. I&#39;m the type of person who learns in a very direct way, ive learned more practicing on my own than I have in any of the classes.  It was a VERY frustrating experience that was totally unexpected(I have a 95 average in all my other classes, including 2 other computer classes(networking and an excel/access based course), and during week 3 i got threatened for plagiarism for googling for homework help so I didnt know what to do.  I had enough conversations with the department chair that I actually produced major changes in the course but my teacher is the type of person who wants to outsmart his students(I got 30 points taken off a project that i did perfectly because I didnt code it in functions, even though he never specified it.  I didnt fight about it because im exhausted at this point).  But thank you for the resources, I have 6 days to master functions and classes for the final which is going to be involving writing an app in python to calculate the costs of 401ks, and then I&#39;m free.  But thank you for the resource, I&#39;ll add it to my growing collection of resources so I can finally nail this."
20238,"Adam G<br>I suggest watching Udemy videos. Even if your only going to survive off the FREE videos.<br><br>Its only gonna get harder, like Network Client-Side and Server-Side Scripting classes. <br><br>Spend an hour or two watching Udemy videos on a video topic. A topic your having difficulty with in class."
20239,this popped up randomly as i have been winding down a semester of hell in &quot;intro to programming&quot; - and office hours.... you couldnt be more right about that..... except my teacher is adjunct and doesnt have office hours.  Its been hell but i just need to master classes and functions by next thursday and im free from hell.

20245,"Thanks man, right now I got loads of work piling on top of me due to my procrastination but seeing this vid. Reminded me why I wanted Computer Science in the first place! <br><br>Im in my 2nd year of CS and its still the first sem I regretted not doing much for my first year and this 1st sem. I wish I could take back the times I was being lazy and that attitude of &quot;Eh Ill flow with the current&quot;. But I got no time to be sad theres still a lot more to be of use! So to anyone in this kind of courses think very very hard on what you really want to do for that is the key to have a good career path and life."
20246,I used to be awfully great in my writing back in the day but the more practical I got the less I enjoyed the stuff they gave me to write aboht
20247,This is so relatable.
20248,"I know its been a year but damn I relate so much...<br>I enjoy working math problems and coding programs but writing it&#39;s such a pain in the neck for me, I am not that creative and I just can&#39;t figure out the direction of where my essay is going, I can do a nice paper but I take so god damn long... On the other hand I like resolving problems, I already know where I&#39;m heading and the feeling of getting the problem right it&#39;s an amazing sense of accomplishment"
20249,"I take a few software engineering classes in high school. In my experience, I don&#39;t ever have a problem with procrastinating on math, science and computer stuff. I procrastinate on writing assignments. Mainly creative ones. They&#39;re the death of me. It&#39;s unlike all the other types of assignments in that there isn&#39;t a clear path to the end, especially if you want to write something good. With code, I always know that I can figure it out eventually, and it helps that I find it fun."
20250,"i am an ibdp student,i have 8 hours of school and  24 hours of homework"
20251,"Lol, I did DP IB and A level, and got A A A for A levels and 42/45 IB, because of this dual shit I got 2 years of gap year to relax, shittiest moment ("
20252,@Mark Wiedeman yeah I also burnt out with IB. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it.
20253,I did an IB too and it honestly can&#39;t compare to the work i have to do now
20254,"pnp072000 The IB program broke my ability to do school work, i overdid it and got burnout"
20255,I did the International Baccalaureate in highschool and the amount of homework that I got is actually more than I do in University.
20256,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=7m59s"">7:59</a> Team work"
20257,"I wish my compsci prof would help guide me, he just repeated back what I said I needed to do. He didn’t guide me at all, I knew what I had to do, he just wouldn’t help me comprehend how to do it."
20258,Fuck your ad
20259,Try doing a video about making a full application start to finish and the proccess
20260,"going to the teachers office hours is good advice, but depending on the school, office hours are non-existent. At the top universities, the professors are never available at their office hours. You have a better chance at a small university that isn&#39;t focused on research. Most research universities the professor is never at their office hours. When people look at which college to attend, first question they should ask the current students is &quot;are the profs available at their office hours and what percent of your classes are taught by TA?&quot;"
20261,Engineering be like 8 hours college and 8 hours homework.
20262,"I would say that I regret skipping class all the time, but the truth is, I don&#39;t... LOL"
20263,Hii. i need some advice from u
20264,"the googling what the easiest degree was got the thumbs up from me haha, first video i&#39;ve seen of yours but i&#39;ll check out some more. appreciate the content"
20265,"this was very helpful to me as a freshman at college, you had amazing insight, thank you."
20266,Where is the list for angel list?
20267,Your video quality is more realistic than real world itself.
20268,Yo I&#39;m Morrocan come here bud you won&#39;t regret
20269,I think if u enjoy learning about computer<br>It’s the easiest degree
20270,So my ears perked up when you said ODU! I currently attend ODU as well dude as a computer science major. Current have a year and a semester left!
20271,My college is 7hrs a day
20272,My collage is my highschool i leave for collage at 7 in the morning and comeback around 4:40pm and i am fuckin tired going and coming back everyday
20273,Don’t live with regrets
20274,Still just trying to figure out what the song is...
20275,Dude I transfer recently I hope one day I come back here and say I graduated yay... I feel dizzy sometimes by working so hard plus you can add to your video about you have to learn to sit 12 hrs without moving
20276,Honestly getting into Computer Science and coding makes me nervous and these videos are genuinely helping me move towards actually getting into college.
20277,"It&#39;s something you can get a feel for right now. Just do some basic programming tutorials, and maybe look into implementing basic data structures and algorithms. I wouldn&#39;t ever recommend going to get a degree in something you know nothing about, as it can be a lot of money and time. Just do some research on the internet and ask questions (much like you&#39;re doing now)"
20278,Is computer science a degree you would recommend going for in a case of a person that has no knowledge of anything amongst that field? I&#39;m currently serving active duty in the Navy and computer science was one of the few degrees that have interested me but I want to make sure I choose the right path. What do you guys think?
20279,What highschool you went to? I&#39;m so stressed with projects and studying for the SAT&#39;s..
20280,I&#39;m at odu right now considering changing my major to computer science
20281,Bro you look like James Franco
20282,Shhhhhiiiiid. I have a retired college professor giving me 4 hours of homework a day. And I have a full time job. College is starting to sound easy.
20283,"Yeah you definitely have to take, at least, some initiative in college. Especially in a more complex degree. Professors basically tell you what you need to go teach yourself outside of class. We talk a lot of theory and then you have to go practice these concepts on your own."
20284,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> same here, except that when I enrolled (18 years ago) there were no alternatives to classic computer science. Plus they treated us like sh**, because they wanted to get rid of at least 50% of the students. It was a traumatic experience and completely ruined my interest in computers for the next 15 years ... 😥<br>I&#39;m attending a UAS now and our curriculum is super exciting (specializations are e.g. robotics/mechatronics, industrial systems, network technology, data science, software engineering, energy informatics)<br><br><br>(The computer science curriculum hasn&#39;t changed a bit since 2001, they&#39;re even using the same programming assignments ...)"
20285,@YKR I take it you&#39;re still in school? It doesn&#39;t sound like you have a grasp on what computer scientists do after graduating. I need to know this before continuing our discussion. I&#39;ve been in the field for 20 years now. How long have you been working as a software engineer / computer scientist? The things you are saying are so fundamentally wrong and misinformed that you must still be in school
20286,"Just coz you can do more does not mean that it’s inherently difficult. In that case IT is more difficult than CS. And I do not want to argue how assembly language is so much more complicated and difficult. It’s like explaining how differential equation is more difficult than algebra. That’s just tells me you do not have grasp on basic programming. I do not want to be Persia all but I feel dumb even to argue about it. <br>And any Tom, dick or Harry can learn basic algorithm and code in ruby or python. Show me someone who wrote a full program in assembly language without going to school"
20287,"@YKR High level languages weren&#39;t built because assembly was too difficult, it was that it was too cumbersome to do the things that we need to do, so we needed to abstract it. IE, making a simple CRUD backend in assembly would take years and years where as in ruby or python it would take maybe a day at most? It&#39;s basically like the difference between walking to a store and driving to a store. Cars were invented so that we could get there faster.<br><br><br>Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking high level languages make things easier. They simply allow us to do MORE, which brings by itself a whole host of difficulties that we couldn&#39;t even begin to work on back in the day of lower level languages. Fields like artificial intelligence, cryptography, scientific computing, etc are all very complex"
20288,"​@John Fedorov I agree that with your perspective that it depends on the person. But you have to remember that the only reason high level language was built because Assembly language and machine language was too difficult for the common masses. And it has  been agreed on most scholarly paper that when you go down to machine level and even to silicon level then the math and physics gets very complicated. By the time you reach to silicon circuits level, you need a minimum understanding of Dynamical Systems &amp; Differential Equations. And in most cases Computer scientist deal with problems with high level programmings. But obviously there are subjects which require very hard mathematics model but I would not say that is the case overall"
20289,"@YKR I think at the level of CS / Math / Physics / Engineering, they are all difficult in different ways and it just depends on how your brain thinks. I know plenty of people who have said CS is harder than engineering (myself included), and others who said the reverse.. and others who say math is the hardest, etc. Just depends on the person."
20290,"If you say computer science is hard, try doing engineering major"
20291,Thank you.
20292,You should be an actor. You have the looks and everything.

20294,I hate math but I want to study network security :(
20295,"My daughter called last night - she is struggling in CS this year (Sophmore) - it is a weed out class...She is a bright student - 34 ACT, 3.8 GPA first year of college.  CS classes, she had a lot of help from fellow students and got good grades - but not perfect.  Taking out CS classes ,shed have a 4.0.  She feels like she can not find the help, maybe missing basics.  What resources - outside of class - can she take (like on line tutoring)?"
20296,My respect for computer science is without limit. Computers are the most horrifyingly complicated things on Earth.
20297,He do tho
20298,you kind of sound like that one guy from the khan academy lessons
20299,This channel is great don&#39;t create another one.
20300,Thank for helping me  Postive face by saying they don&#39;t expect nothing from you. Thank you Brother God  bless you.
20301,@Max Nicely Depends what you mean by master. Watching tutorials and working in a professional environment are two very different things.

20309,how is it going?
20310,"as a senior in high school, thinking of majoring in computer science, this video helped out a lot. Thank you so much!"
20311,"From my admittedly limited understanding of the YouTube algorithm, it&#39;s better to have two channels with different topics and heavily advertising each one on the other. This is because if someone is only interested in only your tech videos and doesn&#39;t click on the personal videos that YouTube will recommend, the algorithm will take that as input to stop recommending videos from that channel all together (not right away obviously). Again, this is only my understanding based on what other YouTubers have said in their videos. Good luck and keep up the great videos!!"
20312,Put all the videos on this channel!
20313,"Thanks so much to cyber tech for helping me hack into my School Database to change all my poor grades from F&quot;s and D&quot;s to A&quot;s and B&quot;s, when its seems i had given up that i would not be graduating when am supposed to along with my friends, cyber tech the database expert did it, first they removed the hold, attendance, boost my GPA, you have doubts check out the reviews below of anyone that ever contacted him after seeing this review.

20316,"@Spicy Shizz no whatever college you go to doesn’t matter to attain a CS degree. The only factors is your preference and an environment that fits you also search for colleges that offering programs that involve Stem. Like my alma mater is Capitol Techology University. They have a 98% job guarantee after graduation in your field if you can’t find a job in 6 months after graduation you can come back do your Masters for free. Also the NSA, and so many tech companies always coming there to hire students. If you looking for a good solid STEM school definitely look up my alma mater"
20317,@Dominic Romero  I have a question does what college you go to matter?

20320,Anyone else literally about to graduate in CS for undergrad and watching this video 😂😂😂😂
20321,"I am procrastinating right now , even though I keep on telling myself not to procrastinate😣🤦🏻‍♂️.. God please, help me!"
20322,Okay thank god I feel the same way! I feel inspired almost
20323,I&#39;m actually really happy with everything that was posted in this video. I was worried when I started the video that I was going to be discouraged by the end but I actually feel more encouraged so thank you for the good advice :D
20324,"I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to have interviews with companies that care more about the behavioral aspect than the technical aspects. To quote them &quot;We can teach you the technical stuff, but we can&#39;t teach you to not be an asshole&quot;"
20325,The biggest thing I hate about computer science is the software internship interviews.  Most cancerous thing ever for an internship that’s meant for students to learn and help the business.
20326,"do you drive a wrx/sti, you look like you would. lmao."
20327,I live in Morocco I was excited when u said Morocco idky
20328,This dude is beautiful
20329,&#39;Can you call something a regret when you still do it up to this day&#39; lol 🙌🙌🙌
20330,Absolute best video to watch before you move to college! TY!
20331,"They&#39;re not the same thing. Think about the relationship between physics and mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering will borrow the &quot;relevant&quot; bits from physics to make solutions in the real world, for the general population. Much is the same relationship between computer science and software engineering. Software engineering borrows the &quot;relevant&quot; bits from CS to make solutions in the real world, for the general population. Computer science at it&#39;s heart is a branch of mathematics, and covers highly theoretical concepts. Software engineering is a part of CS, but CS is so much more than just programming.<br><br><br>Universities now are starting to make the distinction, by offering computer science degrees AND software engineering degrees. I&#39;d say currently, you&#39;ll still end up getting the same kinds of jobs from both degrees because the field is quite new. But I think we&#39;ll soon see CS turn into a more academic degree (much like physics)."
20332,Essentially the same thing but SE is the position while CS is the subject
20333,I know this isn t the place to ask but whats the diffrence between cs and se?
20334,I&#39;m at a stage where i feel like one punch man.<br>i cannot find a mentor in my primary skillset cause i already know too much :/<br>feels sad.

20336,As a computer engineer I completely agree
20337,Yessss do it ✔<br><br>Begin the videos on fishing and boating ❤
20338,Both are fine for becoming a software developer.
20339,I am a highschool student taking AP computer science and am thinking about the degree I want in college. I want to do something related to software or web development. Is CS best or should I go for a software development degree?

20342,"Even if you are the most stupid person in the class, you can still do better than your classmates and succeed. Sometimes the people around you are just the next generation of innovators, and “pioneers of the new age”. The thing you should focus on first is the near future. I learned if you think too far ahead for the future you will start to freak out, and you might mess up that good future you might have had. For example: You freak out about where you should start on a problem, but when you calm down and look at it slowly you will find you could have done it in half the time if you went slower.<br>But what do I know I’m not even in college XD"
20343,I&#39;m gonna start university in 3weeks (software systems science). I&#39;m just v nervous that I am too dumb or the dumbest of the class. Uff

I was thinking that i become hacker or pro level in computer science but i nothing.<br>So i want to start again..<br>And please man guide us ..Which specifications is best..<br>Or what I have to do..<br>🙏
20349,Intergrate it.
20350,"@Kyle Stanley Yeah, and they ought to add a class solely for grammar as for the likes of you."
20351,College*
20352,Italy be like
20353,"Wtf? My college got rid of homework. I would never do homework outside of school, that&#39;s what I&#39;m paying them for."

20357,Where can you find internship and what company? And this is my first year and I’m international student too. Can you please help me what should I do? Also what book and website should I learn for computer science? As a beginner
20358,I think the YouTube algorithm might favor your content more altogether if you have two channels
20359,TimJay software engineering?
20360,is there a college degree for just coding?
20361,Love from Morocco.

20363,that&#39;s actually what i like about CS. it&#39;s more theory and maths than coding
20364,"so true, good vid from cs grad!  I made most of those mistakes too."
20365,For every credit hour set aside 2-3 for study after each class
20366,"wooo boy, glad I&#39;m not the only one that feels like the way you do when it came to computer science degree... Also, I&#39;m reliving the struggle all over again in my masters for Computer Science lol. I guess I like anxiety attacks."
20367,Holy shit this is was in my recommended and I go to ODU
20368,sometimes even StackOverflow<br> doesn&#39;t help out
20369,that&#39;s why  I chose bachelors in IT  and CCNA
20370,Same! Haha I was so lost when he said that
20371,It’s interesting that your classes weren’t programming intensive. I’m a senior computer science student right now and all my classes are coding 😭
20372,"It&#39;s a very very very hard degree with an extremely high drop out rate. But if you succeed, you will live a very happy life."
20373,I’m a first-year student at Butler pursuing a CS degree and this first week of school sure was a wake up call. Thanks for the video it helped a lot
20374,"On the VLOG integration point, I would recommend creating a separate channel. Check out what Graham Stephan has done with his two channels for inspiration. I ended up subscribing to both channels anyway, but it is nice to give your viewers a choice as to what content they are going to expect by subscribing."
20375,Yeah not getting internships early is also my biggest regret. That and I wish I surrounded myself with more people that inspired and motivated me.
20376,Thanks
20377,You thought you were the only one? <br><br>I&#39;m in third year experimenting those thoughts.
20378,I didnt know justin bieber studies CS :P
20379,Man! This helps me a lot
20380,I am starting this course in few days!! And I had the same doubts as you! So is Computer Science worth it or not? 😰😰
20381,"1-2 hours a college, 😂 not in India. 75% attendance is mandatory in India."
20382,Ive never left a comment before so i just wanted to emphasize the importance of how much this helped me clear my head about university and how I should appreciate it more. Thank you very much and I hope you have a great life
20383,"I&#39;m a Junior in high school taking a Computer Science Class at my local trade school (which I&#39;m at for about 2 and a half hours a day) and after I take this class this year and possibly next year I plan of going to college and getting a bachelors degree in game design cause I&#39;ve been wanting to create video games my whole life and I was told that I would want to have a background in Computer Science. And so far I&#39;ve been in the class for about 2 weeks and we&#39;re starting with creating basic apps on a website called app inventer. It&#39;s not hard but the website we&#39;re using to create these apps is totally confusing for me. There&#39;s only 4 people in my class including me and I&#39;m the last one to get a lesson finished everytime. And even then they already started on the next lesson and by the time I&#39;m done with the lesson they&#39;re already more than half way done with the next lesson. So they always need to help me finished it. What would have took me 2 days took them 15 minutes. Then again they have had previous experience with that type of coding and I&#39;m only good with text coding (basically python, which we&#39;re going to do around January or next semester) then next year we&#39;re going into some stuff with C++ which I&#39;m really happy we&#39;re doing since videogames are programmed in C++"
20384,"Great video! I just got a job doing software development at Amazon, this video helped to prepare me for the hard work to come :)"
20385,This channel
20386,"Can someone tell em the difference between computer science, software engineer, and robotics. And which path is better"
20387,DId you ever get a job?
20388,Sunny shah Np! You got this
20389,"@C O L D C L O A K Music Thanks for the motivation boost, i might be able to land a part time contract probably since they don&#39;t have to hire me full time"
20390,"Sunny shah don’t lose hope! Are you willing to move? And apply to jobs outside your field, the wonderful thing about CS is you can have something on the side going while you’re applying and waiting...maybe apply to something part time, hit up your Alumni contacts or go to an Alumni event, but don’t give up. You have a great GPA from a respected school."
20391,@C O L D C L O A K Music ya but i&#39;m just out of all hope at this point
20392,"I graduated May 2019 with Comp-Sci degree, been looking for a job for the last 3 months, and still get rejected at all companies i apply to. I apply for Entry level positions only as of now, and still get rejected. I have tried to watch many videos, read many articles, blogs, and improved on my resume as i moved forward. But, i still get rejected. I don&#39;t know what i am doing wrong, i have put the best of my projects on my resume, i graduated with a 3.6 GPA, and i have 3 months of internship experience. <br>I have no clue as to what exactly the employers want from a Computer Science graduate. But, i am still trying, and in the mean while, i am going to have to get a side job to keep some income flowing."
20393,Why does he look so much like Mathew McConoughey?
20394,Integrate
20395,"from Morroco, you are welcomed anytime if interested ;)"
20396,As a computer science grad
20397,How much do u make right now
20398,Meanwhile in engineering degrees you cannot get most internships until you are at least an upperclassmen. Those entry physics and math classes take forever :&#39;(
20399,Integrate other aspects into your channel!
20400,What was your role as an intern after your sophomore year? Did you code? And did you feel prepared/equipped to do the work?
20401,Angel list is a good platform ! Thanks brother Knight
20402,My challange is code every single day for the next 4 months. With Python
20403,Lol @ me
20404,okidoki
20405,I am a computer science student too and I am  procrastinating a lot..It&#39;s like...I can&#39;t feel the pressure because I am so cool and chill about everything around ..Even didn&#39;t think twice before taking this branch and now it&#39;s a regret nit just a bit ..a lot. I sometimes go through depression due to this .😖
20406,"I&#39;ve experienced all of this. Thankfully I recognized all of it after the first year and a half of college. I am 3 weeks out from finishing my CS degree. I really appreciate that this video exists so people don&#39;t get scared away from CS, but learn to expect the hardships and embrace them. I will identify more so as a software engineer, but I will be a better one because I learned computer science. Imagine trying to be a physicist without understanding calculus. One of those people are worth more money than the other. Luckily my school (Drexel University) is a 5-year program where students have three six-month co-ops (internships) so we build a hefty resume. I would choose a school that offers something similar to the co-op program, but maybe one that is cheaper than Drexel because BOY OH BOY am I up to my neck in loans."
20407,Let&#39;s be honest you never used angellist in college
20408,"Well , if you ever got into the coaching system in India...... 😂😂😂 I’m a CS student too , and in India , all that work is less compared to what we have to do in high school. High school is a nightmare for engineering aspirants"
20409,Great I finished my college pursuing Computer Science Engineering and I regret not using my time wisely. :&#39;(
20410,In India high school is 6 hours a day and college is 10 hours a day😓
20411,Do a different account for vlogs
20412,"Now I&#39;m still a month away from graduating from highschool , I&#39;ve always wanted to  be a computer engineer because it gets into much more stuff to learn about computer development , but now I failed in three tests and I got the chance to have them again yet I won&#39;t be able to get a mark that could get me to be what I want , so is computer science is a good department ? I would sign in any department as long as it has something to do with computers:3"
20413,Prior to taking your computer courses did you have any experience in coding already?
20414,I have no ragrets!!!
20415,I don’t see why you shouldn’t start another channel if you think you can handle some more editing
20416,Hiii Forrest Knight I’m about to choose Computer science for Collegeand also take a pre med course to take the MCAT later on. Do you think its Doable. Please reply when seen.
20417,@Rich 91 incorrect
20418,"@Rich 91 Thank you, yes I am :)"
20419,@Rich 91 Incorrect
20420,"Yup, it&#39;s like the relationship with physics and mechanical engineering. Mech. engineering borrows the &quot;relevant&quot; / &quot;real world&quot; bits of physics and applies them. Much is the same with CS and software engineering"
20421,"Cs is more like abstract ideas, like making something more efficient, whereas software engineering is building software that can be released to the mass public"
20422,I Don&#39;t know how YouTube figured out that i want to study Computer Science .. but i&#39;ll take it .. that was a helpful video .. thanks
20423,I clicked on this video because you kept popping up.
20424,Well how it&#39;s going ? 😗
20425,"This video popped up randomly in my recommended, and It&#39;s the exact video I needed to see. I&#39;m about to start my first semester of university in 3 weeks and I&#39;m going into computer science. Thanks for making such a good video."
20426,Ok so swingers if you and your WiFi are together you are together ...but if your not together then your not having six together ...so ? Who is the winner ...lol hooray for the ???...lol
20427,Ahh free car ...nope that never happens so if you win you could clear my name since you did cheat because of bad coching!
20428,I&#39;m going to University for computer science and this helped! Thanks
20429,You are seriously hot omg❤️
20430,"The biggest mistake someone could make is not knowing anything about programming before starting college. It is such a waste of money if you don’t learn the basics before hand. This was my mistake and why I had to drop out for a while. I thought I was going to learn everything in class, but computer science requires you to do more self learning than any other major imo. So learn the basics and try to code on your own then go to school and you will be able to pass your classes."
20431,"@feedmeramen ahhh I graduated back in December 2020. I started working with pyramid academy in January-end of may. They taught me a lot about Java full stack with react, hibernate and MySQL but they couldn’t find me a client so they let me go thankfully.<br>Last week I started my new job as a contractor for Modis with a client(santeFe college in Florida) to fix their legacy code. The job is fully remote and it seems beginner friendly. So far I haven’t been able to do much because our project leader just came back from his vacation. I think tomorrow we will start getting to code. I’m optimistic with this job because everyone  on the team is supportive and friendly"
20432,@King Blazee any updates on you man?
20433,Ser X well I had an opportunity to work at Google. Failed it and now I’m graduating in December and I’m going to look for job at my college job fair. And I have no internship and my gpa is somewhat average
20434,How&#39;d things go?
20435,Thank you for being a guide for computer science students. I’m going on my senior/junior year of college and I always thought I need to know at least all of Java to get an internship. I’m also pretty worried about not being able to find a job immediately after college too but hopefully I work my way to be like you. Thank you so much and thank you for the link!
20436,is there any jobs from google in programming beside software engineering?
20437,"I am watching this, yet I am already in my final semester of my degree in computer science and statistics."

20440,Ted Macklin odu as is Ohio Dominican or somewhere else?
20441,I’m a computer science junior at ODU this was a great video subbed
20442,Ted Macklin so do you advise me to get into CS major?
20443,I’m a computer science junior at ODU this was a great video subbed
20444,I think he looks nicer like this.
20445,lmfao
20446,No kidding eh. And he&#39;d make a lot more money modeling too and not be stuck under some corporate overlord.
20447,No. He&#39;s gonna grow that hair and look like Jesus 🤣
20448,Came to say that lol
20449,"get a shorter haircut, trim the beard, sleep more and become a model."

20452,You look like griezmann
20453,That’s some helpful shit really thanks for the tips it’s my first year and am struggling so bad
20454,Sam Queen Thank you for ur time and advice Sam. Really appreciate it. I will look into it
20455,"@Ryder You shouldn&#39;t go into computer science because people are telling you to. A CS degree is one of the financially safer degrees, but if you are only interested in the salary than you will be miserable. It is not an easy degree to get. The best thing you can do right now is to think very hard about what makes you passionate. Don&#39;t be afraid to take time and think about what you want. You can still start college and decide while you take your general education classes. Most people end up switching pathways in college, so don&#39;t be afraid to give it some time."
20456,"Sam Queen Thanks for your feedback Sam. The thing is I’m in a current state of confusion. U know they keep telling to what do u like to do n all n do it. Thing is I don’t have any specifics when it comes to professions, feel like the black sheep. So at this moment I’m going for what everyone is going for computer science. And yes I have done some research on the career n it seems promising. But I’m not sure which division use computer science to do. For now software engineering seems nice. But what are your thoughts. Is it good for the long run? U know the income n job security n all. Thanks again"
20457,"Really take some time and consider what you want to do in the future. There are a lot of careers in the field of computer science to choose from. Don&#39;t expect to learn everything about computer science. Later on in your education, you will have to focus on a specific field of computer science. Like software engineering or data analysis. Find out what specifically interests you and go for it!"
20458,Hey guys finishing high school this August n transferring to uni on September. Is it a good idea for me to do  computer science? (I’m studying in Canada btw) I’m horrendously confused on picking my career. Help is appreciated.

20488,Same thing here yo
20489,"So i literaly just got into computer science ( 2 days ago ), and this is what youtube is recommanding me ? suspiciouse!"
20490,"I feel blessed to have free government university education, specially a computer science degree. (Where, in other countries you need a lot of money even if you are clever enough). I should value this opportunity way more than I do right now. In fact, everyone in our country who has got selected to government universities should."
20491,How is it?
20492,Funny how this just popped up in my recommendation..... like I’m gonna start my degree September coming in Computer science.... good content🤞🏾🦉
20493,I don&#39;t know anything about coding. Where should I start?
20494,"@Mario Agreed. Let&#39;s say hypothetically 80% of applicants are white males and 20% are black females. Most diversity-focused companies seem to be more interested in accepting an equal amount of people from each category rather than accepting from each category at an equal rate. So if you live in an area where people of your ethnicity and sex is more likely to apply for that job or internship, you&#39;re at a huge disadvantage."
20495,Jigsaw That’s a huge myth which gets said. Actually I’d say non white people have a better chance in stuff like this due to people looking for diversity
20496,Now people actively avoid them for diversity and pr reasons
20497,EX0stasis I thought white males have privilege (I am not American)
20498,"Internships in the Seattle area are crazy competitive, especially if you&#39;re a white male. Very few classmates I&#39;ve been have managed to get one."

20525,Can I be a software developer with an Information Technology degree
20526,integrate it into this channel.  you are a youtube talent star now.  People want to see more of your personal life
20527,How&#39;re you feeling now???
20528,"Nice video! I&#39;m going to be going to university for comp sci in about 2 years, so good to get some advice and know what to expect!"
20529,I&#39;m lucky there&#39;s no tuition fee for me to pay.
20530,"To be honest this is the scenario every CS student faces, difference is some end-up the right track ,some get lost in this huge ,concrete and complex maze as this field is.....but at the end people find the way!"
20531,I also regret not researching about the curriculum before applying. I also thought it would be a software development course.
20532,"sorry but $80,000/year is absolutely NOTHING you will maybe be able to enjoy 20% of what this planet has to offer if you live frugely. Money is everywhere, you dont need to get a peice of paper to conveince others that you know what your talking about. All this stuff this guy learned is online and if your good then people will hire you when you show you can do what they want. (Thats the whole point of the degree) Or you go the entreperenur path where there is a lot more money and more freedom. As in $80,000/ month working a couple hours a day after 1 year of 80 hour weeks, that is worth it."
20533,"So True ...Computer Science != Development... However, a CS degree CAN make you a better developer because it makes your brain think about problems in a broader scope."
20534,My biggest regret was waiting till my last year to get any type of work or internship experience.
20535,"I want to get into cyber security, penetration testing in specific, but I know near nothing about math, and am in highschool... And don&#39;t know exactly how to get into it as my school and grade level in particular have no open classes for any sort of computer science.."

20544,It’s so weird that the 2 TAs I got for labs were a bit rude and acted like I was bothering him when I came to ask questions and just sounded rude in general. And the other one was constantly late 😐. My other TAs were a bit rude to others too but not me… since I got too scared to ask for help.
20545,That’s very understandable. I’m saying this as a cs student. If I were a TA I’d do the exact same thing
20546,Same hahaha.
20547,@Bryanna Fraase You&#39;re not bothering them and it&#39;s their role as TA to answer your questions. I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;d be more than glad to answer your questions
20548,"Selfishly, as a CS T.A. I like it when students neglect office hours as it just becomes a designated homework time where I get paid. That being said, if a student comes in I will drop everything."

20559,"Alright so i hope people could read this because i seriously need some advice. Now i got my degree in CS back in December and i got accepted at a Computer Science School in Paris for Software Engineering. now i feel super excited for the experience i am going to have but... the thing is at the time i was in University, i leaned so many frameworks and languages that i did not fully master any of them because i felt like i was more interested in this then that and all. i feel like the next 2 years in my Master&#39;s won&#39;t help me master any typical framework that i could use during my career at work. so i&#39;m required to learn python in one of these courses and i&#39;d have to leave Android and Ionic behind. has anybody of you guys been through this and what advice could you give me? (Sorry for the long comment)"
20560,Great video
20561,How is it going so far?
20562,"This just pop-up on my recommendation, thank you for the video. I&#39;m taking Computer Science as my 1st degree and these tips are very helpful. The 1st tip was a surprise because I was doing the same thing, I thought that the lessons were easy so I&#39;m taking it easy but now, maybe I should take things seriously. I just graduated from Highschool and now in my two months in college as a Comp Scie student. And again, Thank you."

20570,"Hey buddy  i just finished my bachelors in IT, and i must say you&#39;re kind of right.. i mean the first year and a half of IT is pretty dull and you rarely get homework. But trust me my last year of IT was a nightmare. I was bombarded with assignments and projects to complete within the same deadline.. just imagine my last semester i had to complete a PHP project,  Android project and also my Senior project whilst also studying for Cisco 4.. i mean that shit was rough man. Just some friendly advice man, don&#39;t think IT is easier than CS, its basically the same thing and most classes common between the 2.. You&#39;re probably not gonna have a rough last semester as i did(i truly hope you don&#39;t, plus it was mostly my fault for procrastinating), and i wish you good luck with you&#39;re degree man."

(I went to college in Europe where it was almost free). I went in every other day to talk to him and it set the tone for doing a very productive undergrad/Masters. I didn&#39;t study CS though, but I am sure that advice applies to all hard sciences/engineering fields."

20605,@Poe Lemic I didnt realize I wrote so much. I spaced it out into paragraphs.
20606,Sorry but I quit after the fourth line.  Hard to read huge paragraph.
20607,"One thing you sure didn&#39;t learn in college, is how to write in a paragraph form where rest of us will read all you wrote."
20608,"I have to say I became very aware of internships BEFORE I entered college which is something I don&#39;t regret. Often times people procrastinate or really hesitate to apply for jobs. As a rising junior now I know someone who had a 3.8+ GPA and never applied to an internship which shocked me. I was like why are you trying to get such a high GPA if you don&#39;t apply to any jobs lol, even I had a 3.62. I was hungry 😂 for an internship and started applying winter break of freshman year. Unfortunately I got nothing and could have done an internship anyway because I failed Calculus I spring semester (and I had to travel) but ended up passing in the summer with a better professor. <br><br>Needless to say sophomore year was a grind for internships and I applied early to every company under the sun. I got an interview with Johnson and Johnson (my brother worked there) but it led to no offer despite a pretty good interview. I actually got an interview with Google for the Engineering Practicum (I recommend freshman and sophomores to apply) but even after moving my interview date, I ended up flopping because I didn&#39;t make time to study and college work flooded my schedule.<br><br> I went to the two career fairs (fall and spring, which is where I also met J&amp;J). I was still determined to apply to as many positions as I could find so applied to REU which are basically research experiences for undergrads which involves coding but also research. <br><br>Networking helped here as I needed to letters of recommendations and just happened to know 2 professors who liked me. One said I was one of the most motivated students he&#39;s ever seen and I would go far 😭. When he told me that freshman year I made sure to connect with him. I ended up landing a summer research position in cybersecurity in Michigan. It gave an amazing opportunity and it will be a great resume booster (I&#39;m already getting recruiters contacting me to apply for jobs which is new). If you want an internship you need to put in the work and really work hard and look. During my sophomore year I had countless rejections J&amp;J, Google, Amazon, Boxed, UPS, etc. and I felt that I would never land anything for this summer and scramble to look for a minimum wage job. I&#39;m not going to lie it felt bad and almost felt a bit bitter after applying to so many jobs only to get one more rejection email in my inbox everyday. Then March rolled around and I got that acceptance letter and I was so excited lol. <br><br>I really recommend networking and going to event like career fairs, utilizing LinkedIn, cold calling recruiters, and also doing things like Hackathons. Also utilizing your school&#39;s career services department for resume critiques which helped me develop a solid resume. I&#39;ve gone there twice freshman and sophomore year and I&#39;m planning on going there again. I also went to a Hackathon and it was a great experience getting into android development and I made my own simple app. There were also recruiters there but since I had a summer research opportunity I didn&#39;t approach them although I did connect with a previous alumni who works at Google. I can&#39;t really say I have many regrets as I came in with the mindset of doing things that will make me employable as early as possible. I don&#39;t expect anyone to hand me a job just because I have a degree :P."

20622,@NCG dont take me as an example but cs isnt hard if you pay attention i had to drop out because i was bad at math and didnt want to waste more money on it i was good at other stuff its just math. i may go back to college after a while but ill go to easier college my mistake was that i went for the hardest college in my country so don&#39;t do my mistake and do a research for all universities and gl.
20623,@obada nw how is it going with the cs? Is it hard?
20624,"Is it so hard? I mean like if you pay attention in class and do all your stuff, is it that hard? I’m gonna major next year but I’m kinda scared and don’t know what to do"
20625,"YouTube spying on me, putting this in my recommended as I do introduction to software engineering. Good vid tho."
20626,"PROGRAMMING.CONFIDENCE opss yeah, my bad. Thank you very much, will check out your channel when I’m free, subbed to you"
20627,PROGRAMMING.CONFIDENCE how about IT?
20628,Planning going to college.. should I choose Computer Science or IT?
20629,His hair is sick. Tutorial? :)
20630,Just recently graduated with a chemistry degree my advice is to utilize all your resources around you to solve your problems and my regret is I focused on getting a good grade on a test instead of trying to actually understand and learn the material
20631,"Man im from morocco, you should definitely give it a shot"
20632,"Other points to consider:<br><br><br>First, similar to office hours: do projects together, especially CS projects. I know academic honesty exists, but that does not prevent you from collaborating with other students on ideas or tactics. It only prevents you from explicitly copying code from each other or from online. Doing projects together is like studying together, which is beneficial because you&#39;re taking in what other people know and contributing to a group idea, which helps everyone learn more.<br><br><br>Second, do outside projects. If you&#39;re looking for a research position because you might want to go into academia, then go to office hours and make friends with professors. But the vast majority of CS students want to work in industry, and the best way to get into industry is by showing you are skilled, passionate, and willing to learn. Do a project by yourself on something that interests you. For example, I like watching sports, particular soccer, and I like playing video games. I ended up working on a personal project where it combined both aspects into a single game. It was the main talking point of every interaction with the recruiting side of a company, whether that be the first recruiter at a career fair, a technical recruiter at an onsite, or even a team manager who may end up being my future boss."
20633,Hey can you give me an update how did it go bro
20634,I hope you see this comment so you can give an update after 3 years
20635,Why?
20636,Same....I&#39;m going to my second year and I feel like I&#39;ve wasted my first year
20637,"I&#39;m a upcoming sophomore for CS, thank you for actually being relatable with my own regrets on my first year in this major. Time to change myself for the better"
20638,"If you wanted to , could you create a 3D video game on a phone or platform with the things you learned in school ?"
20639,I didn&#39;t do my homework in high school and all my bad grades were due to not turning homework in lol .
20640,Greetings from Morocco
20641,"Guys, 3 years passed since you wrote these comments, i guess you all graduated by now. GREAT, I have one simple question. WHAT THE FUCK SHOULD I DO WITH ALL THIS MATH, its my first year,  super excited for programming languages and projects, but it seems that mathematics have an other plan for me, the question is, Should I focus on math?? Is it worth my time? Does is it worth my energy? Should I focus on other things like coding?. Thnx"
20642,"for real, im in my second year and we have only been learning java. We learned a bit of python and c++ but ig my school doesnt care about that?? also it seems like every internship requires u to be a junior and know like 10 different languages"
20643,"Norris Eldridge hi, sorry to bother you, I have a question. I am a grade 12 high school student moving into university. I have chosen Computer Science as my major for now. I have been investigating about careers related to it, and one thing I fear is this dystopian picture of a person sitting behind a computer all day, doing his job and gaining money, but getting no progress or satisfaction. You see, I would like to be more on the innovation front than programming or debugging average stuff, like say for example creating a better way to upscale resolution, while maintaining image quality. Creating an efficient emulator. Same thing with hardware, finding new methods to use specific hardware parts to obtain interesting results in software. It&#39;s like I would like to differentiate what I can offer from he majority. I would like to have an influence, while having a decent pay and going up the career ladder towards maybe management. I don&#39;t want to be another programmer in the large pool of programmers or computer scientists. Do you have any comments or suggestions?"
20644,@Ryan Solanki of course! I would only put ones you feel are particularly impressive though and really I&#39;d more put personal projects. Most technical interviewers understand the work you have to do to get a degree. Many of them had to do those same projects to their degrees. That&#39;s where focusing on personal projects I&#39;d say is preferred because it&#39;s something they haven&#39;t done before and haven&#39;t seen on hundreds of other resumes.
20645,@Norris Eldridge Is it ok to put projects I have completed in my CS classes on my resume?
20646,"Im in college right now, and I definitely feel the internship thing. I haven&#39;t felt like im at the skill level yet to get one so I&#39;ve kinda been pushing it to the side"
20647,You should definitely integrate your personal life into this channel. Maybe have separate playlist with different aspects of your life which also includes software development. Goodluck brother!
20648,welcome to my house bro if you want to come here (Morocco)😊
20649,"@Will do CIS, its a mix of both"
20650,"@Matthew Armbruster God touched my pp, who do I tell, mega God?"
20651,college is easier than highschool
20652,@Tommy Kocal While you go through those books pick up some statistics books and mathematics books and don&#39;t neglect your programming knowledge. All companies I worked at as an ML engineer required strong programming skills and in my country a masters degree as well..
20653,lmao i often wonder what it&#39;s like to be that dumb
20654,I barely passed highschool even though I studied my @$$ off.
20655,"You speak the truth. Another thing I would like to add is this. If you&#39;re planning to work in the public sector like Government then you don&#39;t need to get a Master&#39;s degree in CS. If you want to work in the private sector then it may be different there where a Master&#39;s degree might help you get better pay and what not. <br><br>My story. After I graduated with an undergraduate degree in CS I decided I want to work in Government because of the stability it has. I mean, once you&#39;re in you&#39;ve pretty much secure your future for life. It&#39;s very difficult for you to get fired unless you do something drastically stupid. You can have a mortgage with peace of mind and not worry about being laid off. The downside working in Government is the initial pay is not as high compared to the private sectors and the people you work with are a mix of CS, CIS and the likes in some type of computer fields. You won&#39;t be strictly working with people with CS degrees so some of the programming projects are not exactly up to par. However, once you&#39;ve reached the senior level then the pay will be on par with the private sectors, maybe slightly less but hey you take the good with the bad.<br><br>I went back to school to get a Master&#39;s degree in CS while I was working for the Government. After I attained my Masters degree I went to apply it with  the payroll department but they told me that&#39;s not how it works. You won&#39;t get a pay raise just by having a Master&#39;s degree. I&#39;m not sure if that is the case in the private sectors, but in Government I&#39;ve seen plenty of people with a bachelor degree moving up into management positions. Even if you&#39;re planning not to get into management and just want to be a programmer, you can reach the Principal level with a bachelor degree. Basically what I&#39;m saying is I wasted so much time and money on two years of graduate school that is useless in the Government world. Most of what I&#39;ve learned in graduate school was theoretical Computer Science and very little practical programming that you can apply in your projects at work.<br><br>If you want to work in Government don&#39;t waste your time and money on getting a Master&#39;s degree."
20656,I was just wondering if I should subscribe before watching this video because I have seen your videos a few times and they seemed to correlate with what I wanted to learn. With that line of thought stick with computer topics to keep people watching

20658,"Hey, a 17 year old this side I was interested in cyber security and I had A LOT of question about it<br>Where to begin what to do etc etc<br>Mind if I can talk to you for a moment on discord or any platform you prefer<br>I just need help I’m so lost."
20659,"@ImYosrii No I didn&#39;t, but alot of the same fundamental classes apply to both. You split later on and learn your respective area more in depth. And where they really differentiate was around year 2-3."
20660,Did you study CS before advancing in cyber security?
20661,@chidera I study cyber security at a university. In my experience university is good to teach the fundementals and basic ideas. But the real learning has been through experience in the work place. Interning at large tech firms (won&#39;t name them here) has really helped me develop my skills and learn what companies are looking for skill wise. If you really want to get started I would figure out what path your interested in cyber security and join communities centered around those. Example: If your interested in hacking a site like HackerOne has alot of great resources and tools for practicing in a safe environment.
20662,Jacob B   Did you learn cybersecurity  in school or on your own and what&#39;s learning path like
20663,"Great video! Although I study Cyber Security my internship is focused a lot on coding and automation for menial tasks that analysts may have to perform (threat reports, excel spreadsheets, ticketing etc.) . I was so so worried that I wasn&#39;t going to live up to my bosses expectations of what I could do. But I did my best and he was over the moon ecstatic with the work I performed and has already invited me back for another summer. By biggest tip to any Computer Science/Cyber Security students is to just go out there and do it! Don&#39;t worry about failing because chances are if you just put in the time and effort you will be able to overcome whatever obstacle you may think is in your way."
20664,__ Yea... Also don’t have 7-8 hours of homework. More like 3-4 on a busy day after some prior procrastination.
20665,How the hell are you only having 1-2 hours of class a day? I have like 3-5 hours daily...
20666,I&#39;m from Morocco  :D
20667,I enrolled in cs for how to hack wifi hahahahahahag
20668,"Thank you for making this video. I’m currently in my 2nd year in my cs degree and I’m a little behind on courses but your videos really motivate me to work better and adjust my lazy study habits. (Definitely used a lot of office hours for my python course). A lot of my friends who are in cs have been doing cs since high school and I kinda envy them because they finished projects in about a day or two while it took me almost a 4-8 days, but everyone starts at different paths. For me, it’s all new, so trying to adjust to college has been quite difficult especially with math and cs courses. Great to hear you finished your degree at ODU, i still got a few years left at GMU. Thanks again!"
20669,"I know you&#39;re saying that we are not expected to know everything but all these requirements they put in the application is definitely discouraging. Even worse, when you think you know everything in that list of requirements but still don&#39;t receive any calls. :("

20684,"hey guys so the highest GPA in my country is 4.00 and my GPA in the first year was less than 3.00 and have to repeat 2 classes, maybe that&#39;s because I have some organization &amp; event at that time. If u were me, what u should do in next semester? Focus on academic until ur GPA is more than 3,50 or still working on organization while study? Thankyou"
20685,How did u not kno about internships ….
20686,"@ccriztoff I&#39;m not sure why you feel the need to say things like this, but it is quite apparent that you are just looking to get a rise out of people. Find a hobby that you enjoy and do well in life, and people will respect you. Act like a fool, and people will treat you as such..."
20687,How have things ended up for you?
20688,How to find internship?
20689,"I definitely regret not using office hours and the TAs. I should have asked a thousand questions. I also regret not knowing about internships until my last year. Apparently, you need a year or two of experience for entry level dev jobs."
20690,"if you think the different stuff you want to upload is significantly different from what your main channel is about then it’s better to start a second channel, you’ll avoid messing up your analytics for sponsors, people unsubscribing because they’re not interested in whatever your uploading, I think it probably affects the algorithm for your channel as well"

20702,Thanks for sharing the information bro it means a lot you got a new subscriber
20703,"I mentioned on one of your other videos I think that as a current CS student I see two types of students who excel: 1) those who were awesome mathematicians before they started, and 2) those who could write C/C++ before they started. Those who were math whizzes could focus on learning to code, and those who were programmers could focus on the math. Those who were both? Well they are the superstars. Those of us who were neither? It is a struggle requiring a lot more work - with I think the coding being the easier part. And YES! Go to the professor and TA&#39;s office hours and go the the tutoring center, and if you can afford it have pay tutors lined up because sometimes you need to push that emergency button."

One thing it lacks is a sense of immediate application. In most professions, you can see an immediate application of what you learned yesterday.

Not so much. Algorithmic analysis? They can solve recurrence relations, but I doubt someone needs a relation solved right this minute. <br>TLDR: you need lots of breadth to be able to solve computer problems."

20742,"Curriculum is designed to help the student succeed and develop the skills like in my case chemistry we were bombarded with higher maths, physics, statistics and that’s not really chemistry right? But how can we drive drug discover if we don’t fucking know how to compute and do serial dilutions correctly, how can we fucking know how to make vaccines and medicines if we slack on the courses in the curriculum. And how the hell are we going to pay for Ivy League? Sometimes it astonishes me how people can be so bitter about their misfortunes but didn’t put in the work. Really, amazing how people feel entitled just because they have birth rights. Just that, their parents f*cked and the kids think they deserve all the finer things in life without putting in the work. No one’s going to teach you in college how to successful that’s the beauty of college. You don’t look at failures like it’s the college fault, it’s you who didn’t pass, it’s you who failed the quizzes and homework, whose dumb then? Your classmates passed. And graduated and now landed great jobs. It’s the college’s fault? They count the people who completed their degrees and your gov take census data. So they know who failed. Def not the school. Teachers are also there to teach it’s up to you to learn.<br><br>Anyway back to the comment, who forced you to study then drop out. Don’t waste your parents money by going to school and being forced. Do what you want but education will always be precious. Go become the next Bill Gates, or others….."

Those related to math and physics obviously are heavy in theory, so let&#39;s skip them. <br>Probably what he is talking about is Computer Architecture and all others related to it, Electronics and courses that involve designing (not so much implenenting) software, databases or algorithms. Some univesities don&#39;t have much computer architecture or electronics, because that&#39;s more related to Computer Engineering instead of Computer Science, but most of them do have these kind of courses."
20794,@Antonio Sarosi Really could you give some examples? I did some courses and none of them seem to be that heavy on theory.
20795,About all of them
20796,"When he says there&#39;s a lot of theory, what classes is he talking about?"
20797,thanks for sharing your experiences man...thanks a lot
20798,I wish I could give this video 1k likes a time haha you just said the truth!
20799,@Plaid Snailswhat would you have doen if you didnt study cs
20800,"@Ralph Samson If I knew what I wanted when I first started, I wouldn&#39;t have even gone to college but I graduate next spring so I&#39;m just gonna finish it. The math isn&#39;t that bad, don&#39;t be afraid to fail."
20801,@Plaid Snails so how is CS so far? any regrets and realization? cause I chose IT cause I was afraid of the math in CS but I&#39;ll be willing to shift if CS math isn&#39;t that terrifying
20802,"@Ralph Samson honestly no, just good enough to do cal2 or the highest your university offers."
20803,I know I&#39;m a year late but do I need to be good in math to succeed in Cs? cause I&#39;m bad at math
20804,I&#39;m more than halfway through my cs major and I can confirm there&#39;s lots of theory and math 💀
20805,As a current student these are spot on.
20806,"Def integrate, the viewers will enjoy something different."
20807,The camera quality is breathtaking.
20808,U fucked up?
20809,a little late for me
20810,I’m completely lost in my discrete mathematics course and I’ve failed assembly language once 😭 these two classes are the only ones that have put me into a crappy situation. Idk what it is with assembly and then discrete just messes up my brain but I guess I just need to work even harder!
20811,"hey guys so the highest GPA in my country is 4.00 and my GPA in the first year was less than 3.00 and have to repeat 2 classes, maybe that&#39;s because I have some organization &amp; event at that time. If u were me, what u should do in next semester? Focus on academic until ur GPA is more than 3,50 or still working on organization while study? Thankyou"
20812,"In a software engineering program and this is probably the best advice xD Sometimes it sounds simple until it&#39;s a few hours before the due date and your 1/4 the way through the requirements. Always start asap. Atleast on day one, read the requirements and do some light design."
20813,@Isaura De rivas Stop talking nonsense. It&#39;s like saying you aren&#39;t good at French so I must suck at all languages. There is many different types of mathematics and you don&#39;t have to be a genius with 0.001ms response time on algebra. Maths in CS programs is to teach you though process of logic and is very important if you want to do software engineering and not just development.
20814,No you start the projects the same day you get them. Always work ahead of schedule as this will open time up for those times you might have a difficult exam or test where you won&#39;t be hamstrung with homework and can focus on actually studying for the tests at a leisurely pace. I always had my large assignments done at least a month ahead of time as this gave me ample time to study for exams and not be stressed out thinking I will run out of time and have to cram.
20815,I just did graph theory a week ago in high school. At first it seemed easy but I am only at the beginning
20816,"Some advice for those who are going for CS degrees, when the professor says to start each project at least a week before the due date, it&#39;s best you start it as soon as you get it, no matter how simple it may seem. I would also say that I regret not going to office hours. The only class I really went to for office hours for was Graph Theory, and I wasn&#39;t even technically in the class. I was waiting for a special permission number, which I never got lol."
20817,wow... even at 2x it plays well
20818,This video plays remarkably well at 1.75x speed
20819,You can do it on this channel too
20820,Welcome to Morocco.
20821,"Honestly, make 2 different youtubes"
20822,"@Suman Prasad Thank you for your opinion but today we can learn more rather than focus just one option. My country doesn&#39;t have many that relate with biology (except food factories). If I learn coding and biology, i can apply to bioinformatic or probably research that requires computers and biology.<br><br>Plus people keep saying about IR4 (Industrial Revolution 4) where biology is not give big impact in IR4. The only my university offer minor about engineering or technology course are Computer Science and Industrial Technology.<br><br>At least I can score my minor because I know about programming that I&#39;ve learned from last year. <br><br>If you have any suggestion what minor should I take, please tell me.<br><br>-Computer Science<br>-Chemistry<br>--Astronomy (Physics)<br>--Technology Industry<br>-Criminology<br>-Management<br>-Mathematics<br>-Psychology (I hate it)<br>- Full Biology Elective"
20823,"You like biology so how you had been applied for the computer Science, it&#39;s totally a different stream there is no interconnection between these !!!!!!!!!"
20824,"You like biology so how you had been applied for the computer Science, it&#39;s totally a different stream there is no interconnection between these !!!!!!!!!"
20825,"I <b>was</b> a computer science degree and then i change it to other degree because I dont understand a thing about computer especially Computer Organisation chapter. But somehow programming is growing in me and I think i will make computer science as my minor in next semester.<br><br>CS degree is very high demand (especially in my country) and pretty high salary but I left it. I was lucky to get this degree because of my math is quite good but I never know a thing about computer organisation or programming before. Oh well, its awesome to learn programming for first time in my life but I love biology more🤣"
20826,"(Im from Argentina so the education system might be different, but here is my experience)<br>During high school I was always failing at math, and never really give a fuck about it, I just failed and never studied until it was really necessary to pass an exam. After the exam I used to forgot everything. <br>Now in university things have changed, I study almost everyday math, and its one of my favourite subjects, apart from algebra. And I think this is because I got the proper education I needed to understand the logics of math, and most of the things I realized them by my own with youtube videos, and many webpages like wikipedia.<br>When you understand maths is amazing, what I was taught at school, to follow a mecanichal  solution without thinking why I was doing wasnt the proper way to really learn math. You have to study and understand. It sounds hard, but the more you do, the more you get and the easier it gets."
20827,How hard is math for a computer science degree? Do you think I could do it with a B or a C in normal level high school math? Thanks
20828,"I would like to see you do other things than CS stuff, but not on this channel. I prefer subject specific channels"
20829,"skip to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> your welcome"
20830,you&#39;re losing a lot of weight...
20831,"I&#39;m actually likely choosing computer engineering because i like hardware and software,  but I&#39;ll prolly end up working software in future lol"
20832,unknown person yeah honestly computer engineering was a choice of mine as well
20833,Probably Computer Science or Engineering now lol.
20834,Have you made your mind because I was thinking the same
20835,Am deciding between computer info systems and well..this
20836,I really recommend keeping this channel solely focused on programming.......<br>I just graduated high school and gonna take up software engineer in college.<br>So this channel is extremely helpful
20837,Believe me I have to attend college for 7 hours a day.
20838,Good video!
20839,"Awesome video man! I&#39;m a computer science student from Brazil!<br>I suggest you to put all the videos on this same channel, maybe creating vlog series, and counting it like #1, #2 etc."
20840,Same here!!!!!
20841,"Yeah ... Me too <br>I&#39;m in <a href=""http://b.sc/"">B.sc</a> Compt Science<br>Instead I&#39;m planning to have <br><a href=""http://b.sc/"">B.sc</a> Phy,math,compt sc."
20842,"i would prefer separated , people who want to see vlog content will subscribe to your second channel but not everyone wants to see vlogs if they originally subbed for cs related content."
20843,Making another channel for personal stuff gives opportunity to viewers to filter what they really want to see. I myself do not want to watch your personal stuff right now and would appreciate new channel for such videos.
20844,Welcome to morocco bro ❤
20845,Sir Could you please make a video  explaining the resources you use to learn or enhance your programming skills
20846,Make  a new channel for your other adventures in life
20847,"Do you know how lucky you are to have the Internet as a tool for research? When I was in school for Software Engineering if you are stuck with Math or anything else it was begging the tutors time, if they could help. Consider yourself lucky 😂."
20848,"Watched the whole video before seeing the description , that&#39;s my regret... And some of those things I am already regretting ..."
20849,I would release the CS related videos on certain days and vlog content on certain days.  Example -  CS stuff on Wednesday and vlogs on Saturday.  Then you can keep everything organized on one channel.
20850,The fuck kinda nigga gets a degree in web development
20851,"I felt the same way when I did CS. &quot;Oh I can just chill through this like I did in high school and then still pass it.&quot; and &quot;The teacher will teach me everything&quot;. Boy I could not have been more wrong. Put short; if you don&#39;t have an interest in the subject and are willing to learn outside of class, CS isn&#39;t something you wanna do.<br>I left CS 2 years into it (I was young and sick of school) to go work in sales. Did 2 years in sales and came back to study again. Got a similar degree to CS and now I&#39;m finishing up my bachelors in Webdevelopment 😃.<br>Main difference? During my CS time I didn&#39;t really try to learn anything, except from when I attended classes, whereas In webdevelopment I learn by attending classes and messing around with webdev stuff in my sparetime.<br>Great video and reflection on your time as a CS student 😃👍"
20852,"Tips start at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=2m08s"">2:08</a>"
20853,i&#39;m from morocco wlcm any time budy &lt;3
20854,@KilliKid Alright Mr. MLGKilimanjaroKid😂
20855,Hola Burger the classic business brainlet switch.
20856,The worst subject I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of studying. Barely passed the first year and dropped it immediately after to focus on business instead.
20857,Integrate! because your way of life is what sets you apart from other youtube channels based on software engineering.
20858,Im starting streaming my codeing from 0 to developer in c# do you have any tips for me?
20859,I&#39;d prefer the channels are separated. I love your energy and life style but I&#39;m usually not interested in vlog content.
20860,7 - 8 hours of homework?!?!?!  WTF!!
20861,@tjay t did you ever lewrn
20862,Hi there I have a question is it a field where you can say it’s ethical? And do you work with people who are generally non cheating and with high integrity and good? Haha sorry I’m looking to know more about computer science and the jobs
20863,"Hi, I have a question. What do you mean by compact? A compact language."
20864,Yes and challenge yourself and talk to professionals early on. Don’t talk with your classmates much because they don’t have leverage and experience in the real world. We have LinkedIn now. Go job shadow even if you are not invited. I did all those. And I’ve seen the best and my boss even told me “this is the most elite group I have ever worked with in my life”.
20865,Facts
20866,Also don’t forget to code outside of class and work on projects that interest you.
20867,How do you edit? You look like a far cry character...
20868,"Morrocan viewer here, am engineer student and i enjoy your content a lot .(If you come to Morroco go to Essaouira for skying ;) )"
20869,"Congratulations on your new house. 😊 I don&#39;t know if it makes sense to create a new channel for your vlogs, Personally, I prefer to see all your videos in one place. It makes it easier to manage notifications and such. 😊"
20870,Very cool! Thanks for letting me know 😁
20871,"Dude, just wanna say that Joshua Fluke mentioned you on his latest video."
20872,I would say to put all of those different content ideas within this same youtube channel...would be great diversity in content and would be very good.
20873,Depends on your internship. You can get a shitty internship that pays like garbage if your resume is bad. But there are internships where you can make 20k+ a month
20874,"I’ll be working part time during my college and I’ll be taking CS.If I get an internship in my sophomore year,will I be making enough money like  working a part time?"
20875,Thanks AR!
20876,100k Subs!! Congrats Forrest!
20877,lol im from morocco :)
20878,This channel please but I guess there are people that dont want that kind of content.
20879,"I&#39;ll be entering my sophomore year now, what do you think I should focus more on, &quot;exploring various Comp. Science fields&quot; or &quot;Choosing any 1 field that I&#39;m passionate about.&quot;<br>As later , there&#39;ll be hardly any time left to decide.<br>P.S :- Integrating your 2 different lives in this 1 channel would be great!!"
20880,BRING BACK THE BEARD......!!!!!!
20881,just put everything on this channel
20882,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa6me8wou_k&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> press f to pay respect to americans"
20883,Did you finish the sub counter?
20884,No I didn&#39;t. I found my current job through the network I gained at one of my internships.
20885,"Did you find your job through AngelList, Forrest? Just curious!"
20886,Start a another channel integrating all the things you do outside of work . Dogs and boating 👍🏻👍🏻
20887,Thanks for sharing!
20888,"One of my regrets was swapping one class for another.  I swapped a stats II for senior project class because I didn&#39;t think stats was important back then.  The senior project class was  a team thing and one team was formed a year in advance with all the work already done.  The rest of us had to pick from the left overs and my team sucked.  It was a very sad ending to my college life as everyone else on the team just wanted the degree and didn&#39;t get into the real work.  I can say that I&#39;ve never had one single team project go well in college.  The others just wanted to party, didn&#39;t want to get into the actual work."
20889,Working through bugs and seeing the outputs of the program work properly is very rewarding
20890,"I found programming to be fun, it&#39;s like writing a book."
20891,"Furthermore there is something extremely fulfilling about the act of programming. I have had depression the past 7 months, but programming (something that I want to program at least) always gets me in a flow state of joy. If you can find that joy the homework will be a gift not a chore."
20892,Wow! Thank you for sharing! There&#39;s a lot of great insight in this comment.
20893,"My biggest regret about college, period? Not zoning in and sticking with remaining in the Comp Sci field 20+ years ago. Folks, Forrest is telling us all something with his videos. He&#39;s telling us, essentially, &quot;If this is what you want to do, stay with it; stick with it. It&#39;s not something you do on a whim.&quot; Case in point on this (unrelated note): I wanted to learn to play guitar around the age of 9. My dad thought it was just a flight of fancy thing. He told me, Benny, if I do this for you I want you to stick with it or else I&#39;m cancelling the lessons and no more guitar.&quot; While playing guitar anymore hurts me to play I still play every now and then. Why? Because it&#39;s something I truly enjoy. I play harder pieces, by ear, but I feel it&#39;s rewarding. I&#39;ve also stated on another of Forrest&#39;s videos that I have been programming since before I learned to play guitar. Notice which field got more attention from me? Yes, I do love and enjoy programming, but at the end of the day I came backl to programming; playing music is more of a hobby, not something I want to make money in. So, listen up about porgramming/developing. I&#39;t worth it far more than you realize, even with those headaches, late nights, frustration cracking moments. So, my biggest regret? Not sticking with programming. Plain and simple. It&#39;s why I&#39;m relearning all of that on top of learning Python."
20894,Which major is better for an iOS developer ? Cis or CS?
20895,different channel for non-s/w stuff
20896,Is django good for beginners ? I started studied it a couple of days ago and i just want to make sure if i am doing right ? Please answer it with respect 😘
20897,This is great advice for any major.
20898,I appreciate the feedback!
20899,"I’ve been a huge fan of your channel for a while now, but in my opinion I think it’s best to separate other types of video in a separate channel as I feel like most people in here are subbed for your great advice and tech overviews. Just giving my two cent but regardless I’ll still be here with whatever decision you make, at the end of the day it doesn’t matter about our opinion. It’s your life and whatever fits in better time management wise is the smartest!"
20900,Do you have a college you plan on attending? Check out CS curriculum for that college and you can learn more about what they will be teaching.
20901,"Hey! Sophomore in high school taking ap computer science principles next year for junior year. Hoping to go into cs in college. Anyone have any other advice for me? I’m currently re learning python to review for my class next year; I don’t know what languages we will be learning, and I want to be prepared. Thanks!"
20902,Disagree.
20903,"Yeah, also makes more sense for new viewers too what the channel is actually about."
20904,Start a separate channel. Would make sense to have a vlog channel and a more CS focused channel. I see subscriber counts go down when a channel loses its focus.
20905,Hmm.. I saw that same globe in TJ Maxx the other day. Nice video btw!
20906,"Yeah I realized that I was a terrible college student. Now self teaching web development I have learned need to put into practice what I have learned in a tutorial. So I realized that is what people were doing in the library all the time lol. I learned what I needed at the time but didn&#39;t put it into practice so that I gained the knowledge needed long term. Also, I would like to see Forrest &quot;in the real world&quot; lol especially that new puppy you got and seeing it grow up. It would be cool to see you move into the new place and setup new office. If you have a 2nd channel that is just something else to mange and this is your channel, so put stuff on here what you want. Just my two cents. Good luck on the move."
20907,Yea that made sense. Thanks for the feedback!
20908,"You should put it into the same channel and have vlog (non SE) stuff released on one day and the SE stuff on another day. Putting it on one channel would make your life a hell of a lot easier than using two channels. Also as you have a large number of subscribers anyway creating a new one for other stuff will just redirect views from one channel to the other reducing the amount of potential views for the one channel, whereas if you kept it in one you could only increase the amount of viewers and subscribers. Hope that made sense 😁"
20909,Integration
20910,"@ForrestKnight you think its to late going to college at 22-23 year old?<br>I did a vacational sort of college after high school but it was 2 years only, its worth? Thing is i didnt learn much from it and it didnt interest me so much the way they showed us the IT industry lol, but i wanna start to love it and i need to look for internship but i am lost. <br>Any help/advice?  :)"
20911,19
20912,What was your age when you got into college to study CS ?
20913,haha that&#39;s awesome!
20914,here is a fan from morocco !
20915,thanks for the video very helpfull video
20916,Thanks for all the awesome videos! Angel list was a good gem
20917,I graduated with an Associates degree when I was 18.. Now I&#39;m going to start my degree in Computer Science as well as a minor in Business. I&#39;ll graduate before I even turn 21
20918,"God I wish this video came out before May 20th when my CS classes started! You&#39;re exactly right, I had the same idea. CS=Software development classes=coding all the time. First test since we started coding a little bit, there were 60 questions and 55 of them were just theory and the other 5 were small fragment questions without even using CodeBlocks. Thank you Forrest for putting out these videos!"
20919,I agree this!
20920,I&#39;m down for some vlogs.
20921,"I agree, I follow you because of you, not because of the Computer Science stuff... I mean, of course I&#39;m interesting in them, but there are many outside and I chose you because you really well integrate your genuine life into that"
20922,Integrate into this channel. You can always have your Software Development stuff but other aspects are cool as well for videos!
20923,Second channel pls
20924,Try In Udemy Brother
20925,Hey man Love your content and and this video was awesome as I can relate to it with the procrastination part And I being trying to do android app using MongoDB Stitch and I couldn&#39;t find any anything like tutorial for java part and I thought you could help
20926,Correct! That&#39;s why I said regrets with air quotes. I don&#39;t regret anything because that&#39;s made me who I am today.
20927,"Forrest - Great video! I don&#39;t think you should have any regrets. As long as you learned from the past decisions that you made, I think you are better off!"
20928,Integration! Don&#39;t put yourself in a bubble! I come here to watch whatever you post 😁
20929,Nice vid dude
20930,your vids inspires me to work hard so i can go to college as a cs student!
20931,"I feel like the AngelList website is unintuitive because as I&#39;ve been creating a new account, it seems to just keep looping through the whole account/profile creation process (i.e. the &quot;Find the Right Opportunities&quot; page, the &quot;Welcome to your new profile&quot; page, the &quot;Even better job matches&quot; page, etc.) each time I click the &quot;Continue&quot; button at the bottom of the page. It wasn&#39;t until I figured to click the logo in the top left corner that the site finally broke out of the loop."
20932,That&#39;s a very good way to look at this. Thank you!
20933,"Keep all the content on one channel. CS and your life are not two separate things, one enables the other. After graduating and working in field for a handful of years, I really really got burnt out. My job became my life. Trying to find balance made me a better programmer and thinker. Considering your channel has always been more an engineers “lifestyle” than being ONLY technically dense (a good thing, it’s why I kept watching) I think showing what cs enables would be valuable. Some may disagree, but having that “split” could be the very thing that ends up killing your motivation to keep making videos. For example the dog video, cool. You’re not a robot. And you’re not my resource manual. <br><br>I for one would welcome some talks out in the wild."
20934,"Create a new channel for lifestyle. I really don&#39;t care about ur personal life man, sorry. I hate when youtubers think they need to share more with their audience. I get it if u are known for that but in ur case most of ur audience are here for programming advice and tutorials."
20935,Me rn
20936,"Same, i do it by replying to your comment 😬"
20937,Just......why? Why that happens to us?😩
20938,@Matthew Armbruster let me know of you have questions about islam ☪️
20939,It&#39;s been 3 years since you wrote this comment and i&#39;m still procrastinating
20940,I&#39;m procrastinating right now by watching this video
20941,"Thanks a lot for this video, im going into computer science next year and i know its a lot of work. But im sure if i just chip away at it day by day ill get through fine."
20942,Sure.
20943,I&#39;m currently a CS student. Maybe I&#39;d try it out and somehow do documentation out of it? What do you think?
20944,"Comp Sci is elementary math compared to MechE math. As a MechE grad, I have friends in comp sci who were frightened by the work I was doing in Multivariate Calc, not even Vector Calc or Diff Equations. Comp Sci programs should make students do Physics and Math so they don’t get the “not a real engineer” name calling, that way they’ll actually be able to speak on hardware - software integration, the majority of my field, aerospace industry."
20945,"MrSteal YourGirl I know at my college if you majored in CS, you were only like 3 classes away from getting a Math degree as well, so most CS majors ended up double majoring."
20946,@FrankC.astle214<br>I would just like to point out that computer science is considered a branch of mathematics.
20947,Is computer science that heavy in math? Is it on par with an engineering program like mechanical or civil?
20948,Yea I was always good at math. It wasn&#39;t until college where I actually had to study for it.
20949,"Were u naturally good at math always or did u build yourself up, since computer science is a very math heavy degree?? <br>Oh and love your videos."
20950,@Yash Chaudhary Thnx bro
20951,"Branches don&#39;t matter in computer science , just polish all your skills"
20952,"I’ve seen many videos ,it’s say btech IT will take you to the same destination as a CS degree but it is a longer route to the destination"
20953,I m a beginner ....I chose Btech in Information technology is IT degree worth it???
20954,You should really consider making a new channel for your other hobbies. Doing such on your main channel will ruin your reputation as a CS channel. Also really love your videos and the countless amount of tips you give...👍
20955,"Integrate them into this channel. It&#39;ll probably be better in terms of growth if you have weekly vlogs/ updates. Also, your audience is more integrated into the feedback loop of content."
20956,I am on the same boat right now picking between IT and CS degree
20957,"Do you think an IT degree could be use to apply for a web dev job and software engineer? I like my IT catalog better because i get to learn a lot about many stuff(linux,unix,web, network, database etc) my cs catalogs were just pure math like 3+ math class more than an it degree."
20958,"I&#39;m not familiar with Codeforces, but just by looking it up it seems it&#39;s more programming focused and less theory. Same as what Deepanshu said."
20959,"Codeforces is all about Competitive Programming. They conduct Programming contests regularly. Coming to your question, it will surely help you in practicing algorithms, maths, thinking..... <br>But eventually it&#39;s a website for sport Programming. If you are looking to go there for theoretical knowledge. It&#39;s a no-no."
20960,Please tell me about the site which is called codeforces .. it’s about solving problems <br>Do u think it improves our working in computer science?

22349,Bro you are studying without break for 5 hours I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be anymore productive it&#39;s either your concentration is super high level or you are just shallow writing the whole time. Maximum 3 hours is enough for one session and you should take a proper break each time.<br>Focus on what you should be understanding rather than the amount of time spent studying.

22476,"Sir, You look like Raj Kumar Rao.."
22477,Sir bahut acha padhate hai aur bahut ache hai😍😍
22478,@AspirantJee Bhai aisi baat nahi h maine jee adv bhi dia hai aur GATE bhi abhi mai 2022 passout hun NIT Kurukshetra se aur meri GATE me sahi rank nai aai h ... jisne face kia h whi janta h bhai GATE ka syllabus hi itna hota h ki G*nd fat jati h khatam krne ko ..Uper se mechanical itna jyada vast hai JEE ka syllabus kaafi kam h isse yahan 15 subjects ki indepth knowledge acquire krni pdti hai+ Standard foreign authors ke books se jam ke questions lgana hota hai tb jaakar kahin confidence develop hota hai subjects me .. aur 15 subjects bc concepts itne hote hain ki exam hall me poore mechanical concepts usi time poore accuracy se bhai .. bharosa na ho to ek baar mechanical 2022 ka paper kisi IITIAN se bhi puch lio ..Mera frnd IIT Kharagpur ka tha Usne bhi prepare kia tha 1200 rank aai uski usse bhi achhi to meri aai hai 1043 rank ... Jinhe pta na ho GATE ke baare me naa hi bola karo kuch bhi
22479,@AspirantJee Beta thoda padhai kar last mein nahin toh ghar ke bagal mein Rice field college mein Padega. ..Utna gyaan de...Han Bhai NEET sabse tough hai...Sirf Biology samajhna hai else Physics chem r dead easy...Tu thoda 4 saal Engineering padh lena...Beta tu pehle paida hoja  (Jee crack karle) uske baad udne ko asaan kahega  (Engineering exams LIKE GATE ESE) 😂...My friend from IIT Kgp is struggling from 2yrs to get a psu  😐
22480,@Harikrishna Singh Beta tu sapna kam dekh aur exam analysis se zyada padhai pe dhyaan de ...Waise bhi hum log NITian hokar bahut struggle kar rahe hain Gate mein top 1000 mein rehne ke liye..Even my friend from IIT Kgp Electrical couldn&#39;t secure a rank within 1000 in Gate 2022...No doubt Gate is one of the toughest engineering exams and requires a lot of dedication as engineering concepts are not just cramming formulas like for Jee mains or neet...No doubt Jee advanced top 500 students...they belong to different league...
22481,It&#39;s much tougher than Jee Mains and Neet at least in terms of Application of Concepts but not Jee Advanced ....Many NITiians  even from top ones struggle to get good ranks
22482,"@AspirantJee <br>Bro<br>Beleive me , gate ka 10% syllabus bhi nhi h JEE ka or competition v bahut high h....mene dono diye h<br>Isliye bta rha hu"

22504,Raj Kumar rao in pw
22505,Sir aisa mere sath bhi hua hai
22506,Why are u guys so adamant to find which is the toughest. Every exam has their own level of difficulty and different skills. Obviously post graduation exams are tough since we are in a age of maturity and we make our own decisions not like in school time. Most of us are pressurized to write jee or neet ug exams by parents even if we don&#39;t know the syllabus so the number of participants is going to be more. That doesn&#39;t mean everyone is passionate about writing entrance exam after plus two. But the scenario is different after we graduate we don&#39;t have much options and we are in a position to mold our own future. So it all depends on various factors.<br> I don&#39;t know who came with these labelling  systems lol. People who are saying Google are dumbass. Even anyone can make a website and post something that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a fact
22507,Sir gate se tough neet pg aur inicet exam hota hai aiims for post graduation
22508,Raj kumar roy 😘😘😘😘😘😘i love you❤❤ sirji

22592,Are janab kyu bacho ko bewkof bana rahe ho. Humne bhi college k sath sath gate ka exam dia tha 328 rank thi vo bhi mechanical se jisme sbse jyda bache appear hote h. Gate exam bahut easy hota hai JEE ke exam k samne. Gate k liye 4 months more than sufficient h top 50 me aane k liye. Or 511 rank gate k according achi ni mani jati.

I am just pointing out room for improvement because her inferiority complex is unwarranted.stop simping mate. you&#39;re better than that."

23148,@DM tech tamil try your best to score full marks in aptitude section of 15 marks. Then attempt the engineering mathematics questions. Eigenvalues and matrices questions are common. Laplace transformation too. These are the topics which you must study and attempt. Then after this it&#39;s upto your subject ECE. Buy the book of all previous year questions and start solving all the papers from 2012 to 2022 gate paper and learn the method of solving. If you don&#39;t understand the method them learn the formulas very important. Several questions are formula based. all the best. By the way today was my first class of mtech in iit kharagpur.
23149,I am now in final year

23186,"@Sameeth Farhaan Nah, just have a good CGPA in college (UG) for better placement after MTech or you might want to pursue PhD from MIT or Harvard, and they&#39;re are always damn serious about this."
23187,"Bro, i have a friend, more like &#39;Bhaiyya&#39; from my school days. he was known for being mischief and non-studious guy. he got 68% in 10th and 72% in 12th. he couldnt give JEE, he was helpless even after getting 92% he couldnt give Adv......he got into a top private with scholarship and prepared for GATE and he cracked it....a random guy from our school with 68% and 72% in 10th and 12th Cracked GATE and got himself into an IIT."
23188,People say you need above 90 percentage in both 11th and 12th to pursue masters. Is it true?
23189,@Shubham Joshi Okay.<br>Good luck 👍
23190,@Stoner 07 I am in IT company and it&#39;s around 4 lpa
23191,"Life while preparing gate is not as easy as the video depicts. You gotta be a person who has a good track record of having scored 85% and above in both 10th and 12th. This shows you are really patient enough in spending hours with books and also memory. While preparing for GATE, you gotta be with books for 8hrs + easily every single damn day or else you&#39;re out of the race. It&#39;s not like any guy with a 70% average in both 10th and 12th suddenly grasps the patience required to crack these competitive exams and does it easily. Don&#39;t lose your life by false hopes. Written by a person who lost a whole year preparing for GATE and couldn&#39;t score enough to get into IIT."

So it&#39;s not worth it."

I&#39;m not sure about that.<br>But you can check their website and apply it&#39;s worth a try"
23310,@Kasyap Maddala The competition must be high. I have a cgpa of 7.21 . Do i still stand a chance?
23311,"Two universities in Singapore and two in Germany provide eligibility to apply for Masters based on GATE score<br>Singapore universities  generally take cut off as 90 &#39;percentile&#39;. The admission opening dates are bit off track, i think they open in September-October for Singapore universities<br>Singapore - NUS and NTU <br>In Germany - TU Munich and RWTH"
23312,"2 universities in Singapore offer them ntu and nus, check them but ielts is required I beleive"
23313,For foreign universities no need of GATE. Foreign universities requires UG CGPA for studying PG course in foreign universities and also foreign universities requires IELTS/TOEFL score for studying MS course and requires GMAT score for studying MBA in foreign universities

23856,What if someone do 12hrs smart work a day...? How can you beat that..?<br>Just telling you the reality of competitive world..
23857,i don&#39;t belive in studying for 15 to 18 i don&#39;t believe in hard work i belive in smart work 6 to 7 hour is sufficient...

24433,हां। बल्कि रवि मिश्रा जो कि gate CSE AIR 1 थे 2015 में वो भी मैकेनिकल इंजीनियरिंग से ही थे। IISC का cds department cse पढ़ाता है जिसमे gate machanical से भी एडमिशन ले सकते हैं।
24434,"Hi unknown friend 😇,Namaste 🙏🏻<br>मैंने अभी-अभी 8.96 सीजीपीए के साथ मैकेनिकल इंजीनियरिंग में डिप्लोमा पूरा किया है।  और मैं गवर्नमेंट कॉलेज में बी.टेक मैकेनिकल कर रहा हूं।  इसके अलावा मैं गेट मैकेनिकल की तैयारी भी कर रहा हूं।  अच्छी रैंक मिलने के बाद मैं पीएसयू में नौकरी पाने की सोच रहा हूं।  लेकिन मेरी रुचि कंप्यूटर इंजीनियरिंग में है। समानांतर में मैं सी, सी ++, एचटीएमएल, सी #, पायथन, जावा जैसी कोडिंग भाषा भी सीख रहा हूं।  अगर मुझे GATE मैकेनिकल के माध्यम से PSU या अच्छी कंपनी में नौकरी नहीं मिलती है, तो GATE CSE देकर कंप्यूटर साइंस और इंजीनियरिंग में एमटेक करने का विचार है।  क्या मैं गेट मैकेनिकल देने के बाद गेट सीएसई की तैयारी कर सकता हूं? और अगले साल में gate CSE दे सकता हूं? <br><br>Please give suggestion 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"

25362,All RIGHT 😊😇
25363,Your first point is totly wrong
25364,Sir
25365,Is mtech worth for electrical branch pls tell me
25366,"Last me selection hota usi ka h jo consistently never give up attitude k saath full proof prepare rehta h  or dusra un log ka hota h jo pehle se hi toppers h fod ne vaale, or baaki jitni average janta h wo bas aati h h jaati h ya fir koi avg college join kr leti h ,wese bi premiers IITs+NITs ko chor de to MTech not a viable option specially for core ones! MTech is heaven for circuit branches"
25367,Msc people can. I don&#39;t have exact idea on bsc.
25368,"1)? I&#39;m in Bcs computer science can I prepared for gate and 2)? do mtech, MS, PhD from IT bhayya and friends give me right way <br>3)? And can i do internship after gate<br>During study."
25369,After watching ur videos m get serious i more focused..thank u
25370,Same situation
25371,Study thermal
25372,"For core branches, We have a different story altogether specially for Mech/EE need atleast a year to mug up all the topics and techniques"
25373,"If considering CSE in gate, it&#39;s possible and easy to do that in 5-6 months if daily devote 4-5hrs, There is a study that a normal gate candidate upgrade after or so 2000hrs of study + mocks"
25374,"Hello sir . My name  is  abhi, currently in 2nd year in 4th sem <br>Aur abhi tak mera semester exam chal raha hai . Tho mere pass hardly sir 4 to 5 months bache hai .kya mai etane kam time me gate clear karr lunga sir. Plss suggest me right way  to prepare in leeser time to more topic .plls"

25383,@WebDeveloper_PRATAP bro me 1st year me hu toh muje gate ke liye prepare krna hai next year se kru kya kya resources kha se?
25384,Gate cse tough hoga tumhare liye better hoga ece do.<br>MNCs pe mil jayegi.<br>Pratik bhaiya khud ece se hain.
25385,"It will change ofcourse but for a good cause,better life and positive note"
25386,From ece branch but want to crack gate cse in third year ...how will this effect my college academic life
25387,"@WebDeveloper_PRATAP yeah that&#39;s the main problem, you can&#39;t get admission in reputed foreign universities specially in US through GATE , for that GRE is required that&#39;s why we have only option is to prepare for both exam but both the exam have different syllabus and pattern"
25388,Some private US universities may offer on basis of GATE but of no use as all the reputed foreign universities entangled with TOEFL/GRE
25389,"Bhaiya GATE score se sirf Germany and Singapore me hi admission millta haina , GATE score se USA me addmission nhi millegana ??"
